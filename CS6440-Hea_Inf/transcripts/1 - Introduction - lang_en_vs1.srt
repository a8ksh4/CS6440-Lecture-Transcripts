Hi. Welcome to Introduction to Health Informatics.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,980
I'm Mark Braunstein, and unlike your other Georgia Tech professors,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,430
I was trained as a physician.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,175
However, I came to medical school after MIT,

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,500
interested in applying computers to

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,905
medicine and ended up starting a few companies based on that work.

7
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:24,048
I started the last of these at Georgia Tech's Incubator,

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,795
the Advanced Technology Development Center.

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,830
And when it was acquired,

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,965
I joined the faculty to help create a program in Health Informatics.

11
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,550
This course is about Health Informatics,

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,950
which is the many applications of computing to the delivery of health care.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,545
Since the 1950's, when computers could first store and process large amounts of data,

14
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:51,215
software developers have seen health care as a fertile domain.

15
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:56,010
Electronic medical records systems date back to at least the early 1960.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,105
That's when Akron Children's Hospital and IBM created HIS,

17
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:04,205
the first computer based hospital patient information system.

18
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:07,315
Here, you can see it being tested by a nurse.

19
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:11,370
Another application is clinical decision support systems.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,430
These guide physicians as they deliver care based on

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,770
scientific evidence and they date back to at least 1972, when work began on mycin.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,045
Mycin, was a program for the optimal selection of antibiotics to treat infections.

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:32,100
Ambulatory electronic medical records systems for use outside of hospitals,

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,510
began a bit earlier.

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,190
In fact, as you can see here,

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,989
I oversaw the development and did some of the programming of one of these early EMRs,

27
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:46,230
starting in 1970 at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.
