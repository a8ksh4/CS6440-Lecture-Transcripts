1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
Let's talk about wasteful spending.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,885
I should say at the outset,

3
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:08,395
that this is an understandably contentious issue.

4
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,455
As you can see here,

5
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,725
the IOM has identified sources of waste,

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:20,215
and says that in aggregate they account for around 30% of all U.S. health care spending.

7
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:24,130
A ratio that has remained unchanged for decades.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,850
The widely respected journal Health Affairs,

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,715
breaks wasteful spending into multiple categories.

10
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:34,175
First, are failures of care delivery.

11
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:39,770
This refers to poor execution or failure to adopt best practices,

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,880
such as for effective preventive care or patient safety.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,210
Second, our failures of care coordination.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,227
This means fragmented and disjointed care,

15
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:55,930
such as when patients move from one care setting to another called transitions of care.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,140
Peer coordination turns out to be a major use case for health informatics.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,665
Third, is over treatment.

18
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,650
Here that ignores scientific evidence.

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,335
This complex area includes defensive medicine done to avoid lawsuits.

20
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:15,310
As well as the use of higher price services that have negligible or

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,605
no health benefits over less expensive alternatives.

22
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,520
This is another major use case for informatics.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,585
Specifically, clinical decision support.

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:30,165
You should read the Health Affairs paper for a more detailed discussion.

25
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,940
Fourth, is administrative complexity.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,280
This is excess spending because payers our regulatory agencies create

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,150
inefficient or flawed rules and overly bureaucratic procedures.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,650
As I alluded to earlier,

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,160
I believe the multiplicity of insurance plans and

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,360
government programs here in the US adds to these costs.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Fifth, is pricing failure.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,990
This is when the price of a service exceeds that found in

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,040
a properly functioning marketplace which would expect to be

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,825
equal to the actual costs of production plus a reasonable profit.

35
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,245
For example, here in the US,

36
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:13,270
pharmaceutical costs are significantly higher than in other countries.

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,960
Surprisingly by law, Medicare is prohibited from

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,830
negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to get the best possible prices.

39
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,055
Last, are fraud and abuse.

40
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,800
In addition to the cost of the fraud itself.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,000
This includes the cost of additional inspections and regulations to catch wrongdoing.
