1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,235
As we just discussed, in many cases,

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:06,540
SMART apps launch within the context of

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,500
an existing EA chart charting session where the provider,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,890
patient and encounter are clear.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,280
In other contexts, SMART may need to use open ID connect,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,979
a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 Protocol.

7
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:26,215
It enable apps to verify the identity of the end user

8
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:30,570
based on the authentication performed by the authorization server,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,070
and obtain basic profile information about the end user.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,300
To use open ID connect,

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,085
the app asks for the open ID scope when it request authorization,

12
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:46,000
and it will have access to a user info endpoint that exposes

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,510
user information referred to an open ID as claims.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,160
In SMART, these include the end user's name and

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,045
their unique national provider identifier, NPI.

16
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:00,285
A 10 digit number assigned by

17
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:05,140
CMS providers that uniquely identifies them across healthcare organizations.
