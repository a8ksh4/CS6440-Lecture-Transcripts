by requesting access tokens from OAuth to compliant authorization servers.

require access to a population of patients rather than a single patient.

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,275
Such a service might for example review

00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:36,730
incoming laboratory results and generate clinical alerts when

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,390
specific trigger conditions exist or it might
