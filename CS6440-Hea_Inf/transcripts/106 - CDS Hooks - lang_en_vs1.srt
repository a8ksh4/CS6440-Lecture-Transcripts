00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,415
If you think back to our discussion of FHIR apps integrated into EHRs,

2
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:12,040
it should be clear that the decision to initiate the apps rest with the EHR user.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,980
This in turn rests on the user recognizing that an app

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,850
exists that might be of benefit in a particular patient.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,010
Clinicians are busy, so it is not hard to imagine that this might not happen.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,970
Very much along the lines first explored by Arden,

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,165
the CBS Hook's initiative within SMART

8
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,600
provides a means of imbedding clinical logic within

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,905
the EHR to invoke decision support which might or might not be a full FHIR App.

10
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,670
Unlike with Arden, this occurs within

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,100
a clinician's workflow and because of FHIR there is no curly braces problem.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,550
A hook is functionality provided by software,

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,680
for users of that software,

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,410
to have their own code called under certain circumstances.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,140
Clinical examples of such circumstances might include,

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,420
opening a new patient record,

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,745
authoring a new prescription,

18
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,400
viewing pending orders for approval.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,980
Under such circumstances, CDS Hooks can display cards to

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,305
provide useful information or offer apps to help make optimal clinical decisions.

21
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:30,495
There are three kinds of cards.

22
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:33,605
Information cards convey text.

23
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:40,350
Alternative suggestion cards provide an action different from the one contemplated.

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,900
App link cards suggest the use of an app or reference materials.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,395
Here, I have used

26
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:55,435
the interactive CDS Hooks demonstration tool on their site to show how a hook,

27
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:59,275
inserted into the code for recording new prescriptions,

28
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:02,745
causes the display of a suggestion card.

29
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:06,630
This example explains the potential savings if

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,510
a generic equivalent replaces the brand name drug the provider input.

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,000
