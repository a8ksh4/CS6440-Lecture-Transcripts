1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,825
Sure. I spent the beginning of my career

2
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,690
working on mobile and communications technologies

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,465
both in the government and venture capital

4
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:15,630
investing in emerging communications technology.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,545
And transition from there to healthcare have an M.D.

6
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:25,560
and a PhD in Pharmacology from Emory and did my clinical training in OB GYN.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,535
And decided to leave clinical medicine and focus again on innovation.

8
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,440
But now and the health care sector

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,830
and did some work in venture capital before starting RIMIDI.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,140
I was working with a venture capital group that was talking to

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,825
Fortune 500 companies about what drives their health care cost.

12
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:47,740
And some of the expected usual suspects,

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,015
they're Cancer, Pre-term birth.

14
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:53,560
But I was really surprised that chronic diseases like Diabetes were top

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,640
five health care cost for all of these corporations.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,180
And you know, I had the C level suite from companies like Delta

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,425
talking to me about Diabetes which is a clinician didn't make any sense to me.

18
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,290
You know we know how to manage those diseases.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,165
How can we do such a poor job.

20
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,928
And when I looked into it really decided it was an execution problem.

21
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:15,160
We weren't using data effectively to

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,800
manage the disease in the way that we should be able to.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,970
So RIMIDI's product is a software platform that

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,100
focuses on the whole spectrum of what's needed in diabetes management.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,400
From patient self-management to

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,385
population management to clinical analytics for providers.

27
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:43,060
So we share data across that spectrum patient

28
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,880
generated health data that comes from sensors and devices

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,740
and wearables as well as

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,632
the electronic medical record data that we pull from the EMR systems.

31
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:56,470
And then we perform the analytics on that data to give the right insights and

32
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:06,280
actions to those end users.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:15,140
Sure, so a couple of problems we're addressing there one is there are

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,900
these general population health tools that have been implemented to really help define

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,450
populations in cohorts of patients within

36
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,555
a system and to help that system understand where their pain points are.

37
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,898
But defining population health doesn't solve the problem.

38
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,670
Someone put it to me last week.

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,140
It doesn't change the clinical workflow to know what the problem is in your population.

40
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,720
So remedies really digging into that.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
So our predictive analytics both help the health system know

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,065
how to prioritize and triage the patients with a particular health condition.

43
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,110
So they know where to spend their time.

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,610
But then at the individual patient level,

45
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,650
we let them see the anticipated impact of treatment decisions.

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,620
So, were short circuiting this trial and error process of handing a patient

47
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,440
a new prescription waiting six months for them to come back and

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,645
see what happened and then iterating on that decision again.

49
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,560
It were allowing all of that iteration on screen in front of

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,090
the clinician so they can make

51
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,450
a much more targeted decision about patient treatments right there.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,320
Exactly. Yeah, so on screen you can interact with

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,850
that patient data set and look at

54
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,885
the anticipated outcome of treatment decisions you want to make.

55
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,130
Yes, so as a physician or as

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,290
a nurse practitioner or

57
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,470
other mid-level care provider who are a lot of the clinicians who we work with,

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,980
I'm able to visualize the most likely glucose profile

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,790
with this patient based on the data that this patient's spend monitoring at home.

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,280
So RIMIDI is connected in to their Bluetooth enabled or cellular enabled device.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,985
We're connected to technologies like health kit and other data aggregators.

62
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,885
And then, we do the modeling to show here on the screen,

63
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,505
what the most likely glucose values are at each point during the day.

64
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:04,760
And those are represented by these colored dots.

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,420
And now as I interact with the medications that the patient is

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,470
taking and for instance increase the amount of insulin that they're taking.

67
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,220
You'll see that the whole graph shifts in response to that intervention.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,025
And so I can visualize the impact of that,

69
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,830
not only on their blood glucose but on

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,890
their hemoglobin A1C which is a long term measure of glucose control.

71
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,380
And that's quite important to the patient because we're helping

72
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,930
that patient also connect the dots between,

73
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,265
what I'm telling them today as their clinician

74
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,990
and what in my mind the anticipated outcome is.

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,935
And if we can help patients understand that

76
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,368
really understand what the goal of their therapy is.

77
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,760
We can also impact things

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:50,431
like adherence and engagement.

79
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:55,290
Sure, I think the friction

80
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,870
between a small company like ours that's innovative and a big

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,930
company like Cerner is always going to be speed.

82
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,795
So we can do things and

83
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:08,550
in you know on a dime and they can't and that's just their reality.

84
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,630
We were one of the first companies to come into the marketplace and so they were a lot of

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,090
processes still being put in place in terms of the agreements and the legal side of it,

86
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,970
that you know held it up longer than we wish it had.

87
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,300
But we understand that they need to standardize.

88
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,090
That's the goal of these marketplaces.

89
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,825
There's really a standard process for companies like RIMIDI.

90
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,100
What's been exciting has been to help them drive what some of that process

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,030
looks like and the fire resources they had available when we started.

92
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,490
I think greatly expanded and we've been able to have input on

93
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,190
that and help them understand how to

94
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,560
improve on the workflow that they supported

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,570
initially to make that better and better for their end users.

96
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,935
You know I think the biggest challenge right now is

97
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,695
it's always been market timing for us of you know.

98
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,760
First we need the platform companies to get on board and then we need enough of

99
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,090
their clients to be ready and actually be interested in deploying fire.

100
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,595
And that's finally happening this year,

101
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,620
I think 2017 will be the year where fire will become a reality

102
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,210
in the marketplace not just for early adopters but for the general market.

103
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,220
Part of that is you know driven by meaningful use

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,520
three requirements and the deadline coming up in January,

105
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,350
where a lot of the companies are leveraging fire to fulfill some of those requirements.

106
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,850
We're now leveraging what we've done with Cerner and with Athena

107
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,720
and we're building that out across other fire platforms

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,250
with the great hope that there will be minimal customization that needs to happen as long

109
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,708
as everybody is complying with the spec.

110
00:06:55,708 --> 00:07:00,005
It's early to know that.

111
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:04,500
It's early to know at the individual customer sites.

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,200
How consistent fire resources will be as far as availability.

113
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,060
And will that differ from health system

114
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,070
to health system in terms of what they're allowing.

115
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,900
And then authentication is always the pain points.

116
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,270
I should have said that earlier that the fire integration and

117
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,330
exchanging of discrete data points is pretty simple.

118
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,350
The requirements around authentication not just

119
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,430
with the EMR company but with the individual clients is

120
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:42,190
definitely the heavier lift.

121
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,830
So, the response has been really terrific of having our capabilities

122
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,680
embedded in the EMR and I often say to

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,650
people I'd like for physicians to not even know we exist.

124
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,160
I'd like for them to think wow look what a fantastic feature Cerner has added.

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,440
And, so we're responding to that great feedback and saying okay,

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,130
how can we do this with other disease states?

127
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,070
We're rolling out a congestive heart failure capability

128
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,900
shortly and will continue to expand that across other chronic disease states.
