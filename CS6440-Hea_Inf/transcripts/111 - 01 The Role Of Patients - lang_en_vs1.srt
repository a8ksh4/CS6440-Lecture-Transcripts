1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Most of us can think back to a key role a

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,305
teacher played in shaping our world view or career.

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:11,025
In my case, one such person was Dr. Hiram Curry,

4
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:15,570
a general practitioner who retrained in Neurology and then founded

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,806
the first academic family medicine department

6
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:23,745
where I worked in one of the first ambulatory E.H.R. systems.

7
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:28,675
He taught me many things but one in particular is relevant to this topic.

8
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:33,760
He used to caution his residents that they would see patients for a few minutes

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,970
every so often and think that what they did

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,275
in those brief encounters would make all the difference.

11
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:43,340
He was fond of saying that what the patients did

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,640
between those encounters would actually make that difference.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,945
You know that chronic disease accounts for most health care costs.

14
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:56,870
You also know that a root cause is often behavioral with poor diet and

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,335
lack of sufficient physical activity being key health determinants.

16
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:05,945
You also know that once patients get chronic disease,

17
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:11,460
their compliance with the prescribed treatments is a key driver of the outcome.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,590
In the past, patients were often asked to maintain logs of diet,

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,510
activities or treatment compliance.

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,380
Today of course, inhealth technologies such as smartphone apps and the plethora of

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,995
wearable devices provide an entirely new approach

22
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:31,830
to the maintenance of health and the management of disease.

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,830
This domain of Health Informatics,

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,915
now often called mHealth,

25
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,550
seeks to use data from mobile apps,

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,510
standalone or wearable devices and other sensors to understand health and health stays

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,220
to inform health care actions and to change our behavior

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,650
in order to prevent disease onset.

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,540
It also uses the data to promote behavior change once disease develops such as

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,600
medication inherence and increasingly to

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,575
provide clinical treatment such as virtual physician visits,

32
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:07,000
disease management or cognitive behavioral therapy.
