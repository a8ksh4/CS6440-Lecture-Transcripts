00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,195
We will now look at an example of mHealth that the FDA does regulate.

00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:11,685
As shown here, a live course Kardia mobile device detects the electrocardiogram or

3
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,750
ECG heart trace and sends it to

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,240
the company's smartphone app using

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,260
inaudible ultrasonic signals after requesting access to the microphone.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,700
The company says this communications approach reduces

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,080
battery consumption by around 92% versus Bluetooth,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,170
and provides much higher data resolution.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,070
However, it does require the device to be no more than a foot away from the phone.

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,490
A number of journal articles report on success in using

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:48,640
the AliveCor device and other competing devices to screen for atrial fibrillation,

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,330
the most common cardiac arrhythmia and one that can lead to

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,280
strokes if the condition is not identified and properly treated.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,000
The company says it is working on an ECG band device for Apple's watch.
