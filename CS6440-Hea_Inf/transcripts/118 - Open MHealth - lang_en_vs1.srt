00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Open mHealth is a new nonprofit organization that promotes

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,130
greater access to mobile health data through an open standard and associated tools.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,720
Similarly to FHIR, the open mHealth standard uses rest APIs

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,100
to access data package according to Json based Schemas.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,825
Essentially, the equivalent of FHIR resources,

6
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:28,820
but with important differences because of the special challenges of mHealth data.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,990
Here's an example of part of the open mHealth schema for blood glucose.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,160
In FHIR, this would be an observation resource.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,465
I have placed a part of one of those adjacent to it.

10
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:46,620
I used smart and FHIR's frame tool to create the sample resource.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,440
The important point is that things included in Open mHealth but not in FHIR.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,270
I've highlighted those in red here.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,510
First, you see that the Open mHealth glucose reading can occur over time.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,980
In this case, a four month period.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,020
In clinical practice, it would be a point reading

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,675
usually when the patient is in the physician's office.

17
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:13,760
So, FHIR does not anticipate a situation like this.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,175
As we said, mHealth data has special challenges.

19
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:21,415
And this illustrates one of them, volume.

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:26,445
A diabetes patient might document their blood glucose daily.

21
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,940
They see their physician every four months.

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,145
Does that physician want to see all 120 data points?

23
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,795
Almost certainly not.

24
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:41,530
So Open mHealth is indicated here might provide an average for the four month period.

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,850
For blood pressure, this might be the maximum and minimum over some time period.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,798
Another mHealth challenge is data context,

27
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:53,100
when and how was data collected.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,380
This should be clear in a physician's office,

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,795
but it may not be when the patient is at home.

30
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:03,730
Here, the Schema provides contextual information

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,300
showing that the patient takes their glucose reading upon waking and before eating.

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,170
Physicians usually do something similar when patients visit their office.

33
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,464
Calculated metrics illustrate another challenge,

34
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:20,805
the accuracy of mHealth data.

35
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,660
Step counts is a good example.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,060
Fitbit provides a discussion of

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,410
their step count calculation approach that says in part quote,

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,425
"Fitbit trackers uses a 3-axis accelerometer to understand your motions.

39
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,990
By analyzing acceleration data,

40
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,030
our trackers provide detailed information about frequency, duration,

41
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,890
intensity and patterns of movement to determine your steps taken,

42
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,285
distance traveled, calories burn and sleep quality."

43
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:58,670
Of course, another device might receive different input from its sensors,

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,955
and might do the calculations somewhat differently.

45
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,745
To test the second point,

46
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:08,155
I have long had two activity tracking apps on my phone.

47
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,120
The numbers seem to vary by around 1 percent,

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,755
and the app with a higher number is not consistent.

49
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:17,900
My two apps are on the same phone,

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,710
so they presumably receive the same data from it.

51
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,090
This admittedly nonscientific comparison by

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,560
CNBC shows far greater differences in step counts

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,275
among nine wearable devices where

54
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:37,565
both a sensing technology and the calculation might be different.

55
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,890
I provide a link to an article from

56
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,530
The Journal of Personalized Medicine if you want

57
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,620
more details about the accuracy of mHealth data.

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,705
To better understand the rich possibilities of the standard and the in-house space,

59
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:58,880
I strongly suggest you spend time studying the Open mHealth schema library.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,590
You can also further explore

61
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,000
the somewhat different perspectives of Open mHealth and FHIR.
