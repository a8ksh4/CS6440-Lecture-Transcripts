1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Next, we're going to travel all the way to Baltimore to

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,925
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,250
to speak with Dr. Gerard Anderson,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,280
a professor there and the first author of

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,320
the paper I cite more than any other during this course,

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,220
"The Rising Tide of Chronic Disease in America."

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,790
Well Gerard, thank you so much for being with us today.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,150
It's a thrill to meet you.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm glad to be here.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,460
Great. A decade ago,

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,230
you and your colleague Jane Horvath,

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,900
published what I view as a seminal paper,

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,800
"The Growing Burden of Chronic Disease in America."

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,070
The students of the course,

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,590
if they've been paying attention are quite familiar with it by now.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:47,334
And it opened my mind to the aggregate problem of chronic disease,

17
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:50,475
in a way that really no previous paper had done.

18
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,795
Which is why I view it the way I do.

19
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,240
So we're 10 years later.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,530
Have we made progress? Where are we?

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,150
Well, we have made progress.

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,120
I mean I think what you knew already is that,

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,925
as you saw patients that had chronic disease,

24
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,080
but you didn't know how many patients there were,

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,190
and now we know that there are 150 million Americans,

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,035
almost one out of every two Americans that have one or more chronic conditions.

27
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:21,180
And that is sort of the new information that we were trying to bring 10 years ago.

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
Now what we're trying to do,

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,679
now that we have the attention of the policymakers,

30
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:28,416
is to start changing the delivery system.

31
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,210
That starts with prevention,

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,270
but it goes to care and cure for

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,160
these chronic conditions and there we're making a lot less progress.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,545
I was more optimistic 10 years ago than I am now.

35
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:44,945
Most everything that we've tried recently has just not worked very well.

36
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:47,288
Well, here in the last few years,

37
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:53,005
we've tried to make the healthcare industry adopt health IT,

38
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:58,850
and we've tried to create health information exchanges.

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,795
We're still really early in that.

40
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:05,860
But are you optimistic that that will happen and that it will make a difference.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,075
Well, it is happening,

42
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,670
so I'm very optimistic that it will happen.

43
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,705
What I don't think we've solved very well so far,

44
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,765
is that dashboard problem of a doctor.

45
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:19,110
I have 10 minutes to take care of a patient,

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,535
and she has seven things wrong with her,

47
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:25,245
she's seeing nine other doctors and I have 10 minutes.

48
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:29,535
If I spend most of that time looking at her medical record,

49
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,390
I now have five minutes to talk to her.

50
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,660
And so the challenge is,

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,780
how can we get that information out to

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,100
the physician in a timely fashion for that complex patient?

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,095
For the patient who only has diabetes, it's pretty easy.

54
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:46,620
But for that patient, who has diabetes and

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,010
congestive heart failure and beginning Alzheimer's and arthritis,

56
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,255
and is seeing all these different doctors,

57
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,860
and taking lots of different medications, that's the challenge.

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,440
I hope the students remember that comment because that's

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
basically what we're going to talk about in lesson six of the course.

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,240
Great.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,345
Well, you also mentioned incentives.

62
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:10,155
I mean clearly the healthcare system has never been incented.

63
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,310
Do you see that working?

64
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,800
Are you optimistic that that's actually going to happen in

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,300
this endlessly complex adaptive health care system?

66
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,755
So, I was just amazed when I started this work in the 1990s,

67
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:28,230
that Australia had tried care coordination programs and they had and all failed.

68
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,710
And then I said,

69
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,940
but the United States can do it differently or the UK could do it differently.

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,040
And so I've been looking around the world for those models,

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,425
and I just don't see them yet.

72
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,080
I mean, it's just sort of,

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,200
we know what we need to do which is to get everybody on the same team,

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,670
probably with a nurse practitioner talking to all the doctors,

75
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,977
but we haven't been able to figure it out.

76
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:57,030
So most all of the demonstrations that we've tried,

77
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,694
both in the public sector and the private sector,

78
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:03,020
just haven't been able to save money,

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,095
reduce, improve outcomes, and improve satisfaction.

80
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:12,950
We just don't have very many of those things that hit all three of them very well.

81
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,372
And we're still working and so I'm optimistic that we will find it,

82
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:20,625
but so far, we just haven't been very successful.

83
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,010
Well, your paper actually ends on an optimistic note.

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,090
You point to the re-engineering the healthcare system a century ago,

85
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,090
around new knowledge in public health.

86
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,220
Is it so fundamentally different now that that optimism may be misplaced?

87
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,920
No, but I think if you read it a little more carefully,

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,675
what you'll see is I said,

89
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:45,800
we moved in 50 years from a system

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,863
oriented around infectious disease to one that's oriented on acute illnesses.

91
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:54,240
And then we got that done by about 2000.

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,985
And I said, it is going to take us 50 years to

93
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:00,725
reorient the healthcare system around chronic disease.

94
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,655
We have to start with the evidence base,

95
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:07,310
we have to know how to take care of somebody who has seven things wrong with her,

96
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,975
when the NIH and the FDA exclude all those people from clinical trials.

97
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:18,215
We don't have the educational system and the medical schools oriented around that.

98
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,700
We don't have the financing,

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,040
and so right now,

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,205
there isn't a real strong incentive for

101
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:28,610
hospitals and doctors to really go after these people,

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,275
to take care of them in an effective way.

103
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,350
In fact, because they don't know how to do it,

104
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,900
they want to run away from them in most cases.

105
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,265
But this is where the money is.

106
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:42,945
Two-thirds of Medicare spending is by people with five or more chronic conditions.

107
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:46,520
We've got to get the system right for these people,

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,530
we just don't know how to do it yet.

109
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,526
So, I can't speak to 50 years ago,

110
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:52,925
but 40 years ago,

111
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,375
I was a medical student.

112
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,980
First getting interested in this.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,740
And I remember going to meetings,

114
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,880
and they would say, well here's where we are,

115
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,045
and if these trends continue and we don't do anything by right about now,

116
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:08,430
health care will be consuming 20% of the gross domestic product,

117
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,190
a number that's absolutely not sustainable.

118
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,690
Right.

119
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,840
Now I've seen projections from OMB and others,

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,003
that if we don't do anything it will be 40% in 50 years.

121
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,530
Do we have 50 years?

122
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,300
Well, when I started working and trying to

123
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,810
control health care costs in the 1970s, I said,

124
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,800
we'll never be able to sustain 10% of GDP on healthcare,

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,535
now it's close to 20.

126
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:39,085
So, I've stopped making projections as to whether or not we can afford to do something.

127
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,365
What we know is that by the time it gets to almost 30%,

128
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:44,200
which isn't that far along,

129
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,550
almost all the growth in the economy,

130
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,580
all the productivity growth in the economy will in

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,145
fact go to support the growth in healthcare,

132
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,485
and that's probably not sustainable.

133
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,425
But we don't know what's going to turn the ship around,

134
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:03,320
maybe it's IT, maybe it's changing the financial incentives,

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,430
but since everybody is making so much money in healthcare, and you know,

136
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,825
jobs are important and financial security is important,

137
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,470
it's going to be a really tough change.

138
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,705
So many of us speculate that eventually with our backs against the wall,

139
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,790
we'll adopt a single payer system like every other country on earth.

140
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,390
You think that's going to happen here in the US?

141
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,895
I was more optimistic in the 90s than I am today.

142
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:35,230
Basically, Americans love choice.

143
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,370
All you have to do is go to a grocery store and go down the cereal aisle and

144
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,565
look at 40 to 100 different choices of cereal,

145
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,280
whereas if you go to France,

146
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,645
you'll see two or three in most cases.

147
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,395
Choice is what makes America,

148
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:56,950
and is going to be really hard to get the private insurance industry out of it.

149
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,960
We can't even get right now,

150
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,780
many of the states, to embrace Medicaid,

151
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,640
so if they can't embrace Medicaid which is free money to them,

152
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,970
why would we think that they would go to a single payer?

153
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,750
I mean, I think it makes sense.

154
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,590
It means that we pay a lot more for healthcare

155
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,525
than other industrialized countries because of this choice,

156
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:21,290
but America seems to really like choice.

157
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,615
Well, thank you very much.

158
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,680
It's been a pleasure.

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you.

160
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,380
Maybe we'll be able to get together 10 more years and see what's happened.

161
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,000
I hopefully it will be more optimistic that time.
