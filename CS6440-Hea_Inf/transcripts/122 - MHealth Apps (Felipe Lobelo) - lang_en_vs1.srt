1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,171
So I'm Felipe Lobelo,

2
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:13,090
I'm a preventive medicine doctor and I work at the Emory School Public Health,

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,880
the Hubert Department of Global Health and I direct

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:23,280
the Exercise Medicine Research Center.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,920
The mission really is to evaluate the implementation of the Exercises Medicine in

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,980
Global Initiative which in a nutshell is

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,225
trying to make physical activity part of health care.

8
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,323
Really, when you think about

9
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:43,410
main risk factors for chronic disease and mortality around the world,

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,395
inactivity has been sort of overlooked.

11
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:49,230
And what we're trying to do here is to make sure

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,755
that physicians and healthcare systems assess

13
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:55,320
patients physical activity and provide

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,850
some recommendations or counseling to help them improve physical activity.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,040
And as a result, improve your health.

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:14,070
Absolutely, so we see mHealth and patient

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,040
generated data as really

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,160
critical to the implementation of the Exercise Medicine Initiative.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,925
For the last few years,

20
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:26,655
some healthcare systems have started implementing

21
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:30,250
physical activity questions in their electronic medical records,

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,435
but as many of you know,

23
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,910
there's a lot of action around using

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:42,220
wearable devices to objectively measure people's physical activity level.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,715
And some health systems are starting to

26
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:50,220
pilot test implementation of these data to guide clinical counseling.

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,290
Now, these are really early stages in this period and there's a lot of questions.

28
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:04,080
We typically refer to this as the Wild Wild West of mHelp because issues around validity,

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,530
and privacy, and interpretation of the data,

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:14,750
and interoperability are really at the cross of making this routine care.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,060
Yes, there's a number of initiatives and groups that are actively

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,969
working to solve some of these issues and to improve not only the quality of the data,

33
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,345
but also the use of it.

34
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:38,675
So in terms of the quality and the standardization of different devices,

35
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:43,910
there's a number of projects going on that are trying to essentially assess,

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,365
no the mean error,

37
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,515
which devices are more accurate than others.

38
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,980
There's also different use cases depending on

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,985
the clinical population you may want to choose one device over the other.

40
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:04,501
There's really no central repository of these data or these recommendations,

41
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,875
but the American College Sports Medicine,

42
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:11,075
the CTA standards section,

43
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,490
the American Heart Association and others are

44
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,353
actively working to solve some of those issues.

45
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:22,460
At the end of the day like any other measurement in clinical care,

46
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,075
in medicine, is not going to be perfect,

47
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,925
there's going to be some error.

48
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,585
But we think that at least the process needs to be streamlined and so,

49
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:37,570
critical aspects around data standardization need to be in place.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:47,600
Yes, so I was lucky enough to connect with a group of brilliant students that had

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,720
a passion for this area and also the knowledge and the

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,595
expertise to at least start to solve some of these problems.

53
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:58,535
So, one of the issues that we have is that,

54
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:04,409
there is sort of bring your own approach to patient generated data.

55
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,465
In some cases, a clinician may want to prescribe if he will,

56
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,075
a certain device to assess activity,

57
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,425
but for the most part,

58
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:17,180
this is a consumer oriented industry and patients are going to have

59
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,890
a device and they want to have that data provide some deep,

60
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,175
taking into account with clinical counseling,

61
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:31,220
so the main aspect of the project the students worked on,

62
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,940
was to try to integrate different sources of

63
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,215
data from different devices into the electronic medical record.

64
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:41,720
And also, make sure that

65
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,290
the critical useful aspects of

66
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,830
the data are being presented to the clinician in a simple way.

67
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,910
Because as you know,

68
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,190
these devices collect a lot of data.

69
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,130
There's a lot of noise and you really want

70
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,725
the meaningful use aspect of this to become what gets integrated into FHIR,

71
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:06,380
so that was the main objective of that project.

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:16,665
Yes. So essentially, the students were able to capture the data on the back end of

73
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:21,615
a few wearable devices that we identified as being

74
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,880
accurate and appropriate for

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,155
these different use cases and in lifestyle medicine and counseling.

76
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:32,150
And then, we made sure that the data was

77
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,360
transformed in a way that was connected to public health guidelines.

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,875
Typically, these devices collect steps but

79
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,410
the recommendations from the CDC and

80
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,615
other public health organizations are not really around steps,

81
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:50,235
are around minutes of physical activity per week.

82
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:53,790
So, we made a transformation of the students work on transforming

83
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,930
that data from different metric steps into minutes of

84
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,620
moderate to vigorous physical activity and draw a line

85
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,610
or set the standard for what is the appropriate weekly dose,

86
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,860
if you will, recommended by

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,870
public health organizations and make sure that that visualization aspect of

88
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:21,110
the data was clear as we intend to migrate this data into electronic medical records.

89
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,930
So here you can see that once the data is

90
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,150
being capture from the back end of the wearable device that we selected,

91
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,335
then it needs to be transformed from the metric

92
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:38,930
that the device uses into minutes of physical activity per week.

93
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,355
And then, you have weekly,

94
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,085
daily data being captured.

95
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:48,735
And then, you have to combine the daily data into a weekly metric.

96
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:55,815
Because, the volume of activity per week is the recommended public health guideline.

97
00:06:55,815 --> 00:07:00,270
So, when you combine weekly data into,

98
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,620
or daily data into a weekly standard of

99
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,680
150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity,

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,860
then you can see a line that essentially helps a clinician identify if for that week,

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,300
that patient met the recommended dose of activity.

102
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,955
In addition to the total dose of activity per week,

103
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:24,985
you also have the intensity of activity.

104
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:30,180
So again, the recommendation is for 150 minutes of moderate,

105
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,335
or vigorous exercise, or physical activity.

106
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:37,525
And in essence, vigorous minutes count twice.

107
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,590
So, plus part of this project,

108
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,500
the metrics need to be adjusted so that

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,435
minutes of moderate intensity activity are combined.

110
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,620
And you can see here in a different color,

111
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,340
with minutes of vigorous intensity activity in order

112
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,970
to come up with the recommended public health metrics.

113
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,855
So, using different visualization aspects, colors,

114
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:05,760
a threshold line that helps the clinician

115
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,335
identify what's a dose and whether that patient is meeting that dose or not.

116
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:14,295
Should be able to simplify the process of

117
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:18,120
interpreting that data in leading into the counseling,

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,678
that the clinician can provide to that patient.

119
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:31,705
My pleasure Mark and thanks for inviting me to work with this class and your students.

120
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:38,385
It's a great opportunity to combine different expertise

121
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,370
and issues around the interoperability

122
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,000
of mobile health and looking forward to working in more of these projects.
