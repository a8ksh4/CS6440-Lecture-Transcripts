1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,760
Sure, I've been at CDC for a little over 20 years.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,445
I started in the Epidemic Intelligence Service Program,

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:16,650
and I've really spent my career at CDC working on surveillance issues.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,670
As you probably know,

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,510
public health surveillance is really the cornerstone of the work we do.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,280
We need good data in order to make decisions about preventing diseases,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,185
controlling diseases, interventions, et cetera.

8
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:32,310
So, I've really enjoyed working on surveillance issues,

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,615
and today we're going to talk to you about one of our big national programs.

10
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,915
I started with CDC as a public health advisor for a short period of time,

11
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,255
but I end up redirecting my career at the state level.

12
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:45,945
I worked mainly with Georgia and Virginia,

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,120
and then with a organization called

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,895
the National Association of County and City Health Officials,

15
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,650
before I returned to CDC.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,060
And most of my career has been in surveillance as well.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,835
Well, syndromic surveillance has been around for a long time,

18
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:08,680
but it really got its start after 9/11 and the anthrax attacks.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,715
And the purpose at that time was to use emergency data,

20
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,500
data from emergency departments,

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,130
to look for those first instances of a bioterrorism attack.

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,700
That was really the reason for setting up these systems.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,315
But now, the use cases for syndromic surveillance has really grown.

24
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,720
It's used for a number of different things.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,185
It's used to track infectious disease trends like the flu every year.

26
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:35,560
It's used to monitor mass gatherings,

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,590
because there could be events happening at mass gatherings,

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,558
whether health related or otherwise.

29
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:48,455
It's used to look at the impact of man-made and natural disasters, hurricanes.

30
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:52,060
And it's used to look at the impact of extreme weather events,

31
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,470
such as heat events or cold events.

32
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,470
So the use cases for Syndromic surveillance have really broadened over time.

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,220
Sure, Michael, why don't you talk about that.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,575
Okay. Well, Florida has done really good work in this area,

35
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:15,630
and their system that they have locally is really the precursor,

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,626
the system that we have established nationally.

37
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:22,800
So, the hurricane Wilma came by,

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,700
they used it to monitor things like prescription drug,

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,620
or carbon monoxide, and things like that that

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,690
would help them respond better to the event.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,225
We mentioned emergency department data,

42
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,600
but Florida is a great example where they're using

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,135
their systems to pull in all different kinds of data.

44
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:42,595
Poison data, emergency medical services data, et cetera.

45
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,995
They're really one of the premier programs around the country.

46
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:49,005
One of the things I wanted to mention about the importance of it is,

47
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,860
it's really about the timeliness of the data.

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,470
It's also about the ability to see things that you would not otherwise have reported.

49
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,135
So, for example, with the oil spill,

50
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:03,120
there is no code for oil spill,

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,495
but you might want to know whether health effect's related to the oil spill.

52
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,830
And because you get every record,

53
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,250
you can sort through what may be happening.

54
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,540
Yeah, I think it's important for people to realize that

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,615
syndromic surveillance is not about case finding.

56
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:19,015
We do a lot of surveillance at CDC and across public health.

57
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:24,180
It's about finding specific cases of infectious diseases or other types of things.

58
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,895
Syndromic surveillance is really prediagnostic.

59
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:32,280
It's all that information that's collected in an ED visit such as chief complaint,

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,095
triage notes, et cetera.

61
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:36,000
And we use different types of tools,

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
such as natural language processing,

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,305
to really dig through that very rich data,

64
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:45,750
to get a feel for what might be happening in a community.

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,575
Sure. So, we work off of currently the HL7251 standard,

66
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,600
and we have, over the last few years,

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,080
developed a standard messaging guide that would help

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,479
facilities determine both which admit,

69
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,085
discharge, and transfer messages to send,

70
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,755
and what parts of those messages should be sent.

71
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,340
And so, that actually helps organize the data in

72
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,250
a way that we understand what's coming from their system,

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,450
and they understand what they're sending,

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,010
in the same kind of language.

75
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,005
And then once we take those data in,

76
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:26,360
unfortunately, within HL7, there's lots of wiggle rooms,

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,380
so a lot of times we do some integration of our own,

78
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,170
where we're accounting for differences in whether you used

79
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,535
an OBX segment or whether you had it in a proper place, and things like that.

80
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:39,350
Once we kind of organize the data,

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,895
then we pass it off to applications that are prepared and ready to read those things.

82
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:50,200
Correct.

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,520
And I should add that the meaningful use program,

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,410
which I'm sure most people are familiar with,

85
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,020
has really been a boost for Syndromic surveillance.

86
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,140
This has really been the carrot that has encouraged

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,500
clinical care to share their data with Public Health,

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,020
both at the state and local level, and then eventually,

89
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,535
at CDC as well.

90
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:18,400
Sure. It's developed by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab,

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,240
and it's been in development since late 90s.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,185
They worked first with the DoD under a ditcher project,

93
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,915
and there was a lot of

94
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:33,010
feedback from the public health practitioner community over the last 10 to 15 years that

95
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,130
has really helped them develop the application to do the types of things

96
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,630
that an epidemiologist at a state or local level wants it to do.

97
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,920
It's actually based on Microsoft SQL server in general,

98
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,470
and there is a lot of different DTS Packages and things that move data back and forth,

99
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,795
and transform data within,

100
00:05:54,795 --> 00:06:00,060
they do some things to try to get the system to react quickly.

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,605
One of the things that makes ESSENCE different is,

102
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,875
you can do ad hoc queries on large text blocks,

103
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,810
which most systems won't let you do,

104
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,120
because it's pretty intensive.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,460
They, of course, end up using cubes,

106
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,050
and using ways to narrow the focus down of your query,

107
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,565
so that you're within a reasonable amount of data.

108
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,710
But, at our level,

109
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,705
we've really been pushing the limits of that,

110
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:26,350
because the national size of things is quite large.

111
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,440
So, we're actually learning and redeveloping with

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,765
Johns Hopkins as we push the limits of that system.

113
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:36,510
I think we're up to about two and a half million messages per day,

114
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,940
and we keep having to increase our server size.

115
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,210
So, we really need to think about database management for the future,

116
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,260
and how we're going to deal with all this big data.

117
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,345
Well, there's different ways to measure that,

118
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,670
and I guess I would say that,

119
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,900
we're ordering 45 terabytes of space for the best,

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,750
or set of data.

121
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,990
But remember that HL7 messages come several,

122
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,560
it depends on the iteration or the implementation of the EHR.

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,530
You can get up to you know,

124
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,270
from 2 to 30 different messages per visit.

125
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,080
So, part of the problem is culling all that down and getting it organized.

126
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,265
But we have, after you do all that,

127
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:29,960
I think are around 300,000 visits a day that are coming through the system.

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,005
So when a patient goes to an ED,

129
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:36,605
we don't get a nice record that includes everything that happened to them at the ED.

130
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,900
Every time they have an encounter with someone,

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,090
whether it's an examination or a test,

132
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,320
all of those messages or records come separately.

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,315
So, we have the challenge of concatenating those records into a meaningful patient visit,

134
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:55,730
that can then be pulled into the analytic tools for analysis.

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,610
We have about 54% of all of the EDs

136
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,545
based on an AJ survey that we use to sort of determine the denominator.

137
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:10,015
And we have on the order of about 65% of all ED visits,

138
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:13,190
mostly on the eastern half of the United States.

139
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,485
But we continue to on-board the sort of western Afghanistan.

140
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:19,330
And I think it's important to clarify that

141
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,410
syndromic surveillance is most valuable at the local level,

142
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,830
because that's where public health takes action.

143
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,425
So most of the states in the country,

144
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,065
and many of the large local health departments,

145
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,490
New York City and others,

146
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,010
have their own syndromic surveillance programs

147
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,990
that are used across the health department.

148
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,465
And they're the ones that monitor the data on a daily basis,

149
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:43,930
and take action based on what they're seeing.

150
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,690
At CDC, we have the biosense platform that

151
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,005
receives data from the state and local health departments,

152
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:53,270
either a copy of the data or the data sent to us.

153
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,115
So, we don't really review the data and act on what we're seeing,

154
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:58,625
that happens at the local level.

155
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,450
But we have national and regional views that

156
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,675
can be shared and people are comparing their data with that,

157
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:08,435
we can bring states together when we see things happening across the country.

158
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,830
At different levels of public health,

159
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,701
whether it's local, state or federal,

160
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:22,595
you have different use cases for the data.

161
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,160
I think the heroin example would be great,

162
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,270
because that's a very timely issue now.

163
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,695
Sure.

164
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,570
Syndromic surveillance is becoming

165
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,750
the surveillance tool for opioid overdoses in the country,

166
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,130
because there's really no other source of data for this.

167
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:42,950
Right. So, we worked with our Injury Prevention Center to really understand what's

168
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,330
the best way to characterize

169
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,150
the heroin overdose activity

170
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,100
within the text blocks that we get, within the ICD codes that we get.

171
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,570
Remember that, though we get very

172
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,485
complete reporting for chief complaints and triage notes often,

173
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,650
we don't always get complete reporting with ICD codes.

174
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,060
So we do kind of a mix,

175
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,055
and they've been really honing in on how to best characterize what's happening.

176
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:11,420
And then, there's a visualization where you can see the percent of ED visits,

177
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,775
and you can see the trend line over time of

178
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,820
the heroin overdose activity for a couple of different sites.

179
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,870
And this the type of thing that will do,

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,180
either in conjunction with a CC program like injury,

181
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,295
where we're helping the folks in the field determine the best way to capture the topic,

182
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:35,090
and we can also look like Polysed

183
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,670
National or HHS regional trends and help to understand where do we need to put resources.

184
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,310
Is it worse in one area over another?

185
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,740
So, I think another important thing to understand

186
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,465
about syndromic surveillance is when you get this data,

187
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,610
what we do initially,

188
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,000
is to bin the data into syndrome category.

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,565
So, there might be an influenza-like syndrome,

190
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,120
there may be a heroin syndrome,

191
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,210
there's more than a dozen or 25 different syndromes.

192
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,830
So we work with the states,

193
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,225
the local and state health departments on those syndrome definitions,

194
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:11,765
because those are the definitions that are applied when you're analyzing the data,

195
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,710
so that you can really see what's happening.

196
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:21,140
And these syndromes change on a very frequent basis as new drugs or illicit drugs,

197
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,870
would come on the market in a particular community.

198
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,710
They can add some of that terminology to the syndrome definition,

199
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,200
so they make sure they're picking up what's being pulled out

200
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,750
of the emergency departments.

201
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you, Mark.
