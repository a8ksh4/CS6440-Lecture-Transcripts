1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,190
Yes, I'm Paula Braun.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,250
I'm an entrepreneur in residence with

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,140
the National Center for Health Statistics at

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,895
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

5
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,510
I'm Ryan Hoffman. I am a PhD student

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,570
in Biomedical Engineering in Dr. May Kwong's lab at Georgia Tech.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,980
Yes. So, the clinical decision support tool that we're developing,

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,735
is specifically designed to help

9
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,200
physicians collect more complete and accurate information on

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,535
death certificates and to send that information to the state where the death occurred.

11
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:44,270
And what makes death reporting challenging is that,

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,255
the clinician is required to make a decision

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,380
about the sequence of events that led to death.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,730
Typically, it's somewhat more clear to understand the immediate cause of death,

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,180
but to provide enough information on the death certificate

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,850
to ascertain the underlying cause,

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,620
can be quite of challenge.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,690
However, there's ample information in

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,460
some circumstances in the electronic medical record.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,910
And so, the tool that we've developed is designed specifically to try to fetch

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,980
that data and to put it in a easily interpretable display so that way,

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,260
the clinician isn't combing through

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,825
multiple tabs and spending a lot of time trying to figure out,

24
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,050
what is this patient's health history?

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,970
And it goes a step further where it's not just

26
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,165
about displaying information that's in the medical record,

27
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:40,850
but ultimately connecting to an external analytical engine that applies

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,120
more advanced analytics to return recommendations

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,100
about probable sequences of events that may have led to death.

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,340
Absolutely. So here you can see the main interface,

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,740
the main screen of our cause of death reporting prototype app.

32
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,300
The main feature of the app is this timeline right here in the middle.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,485
We wanted to be able to show not just the immediate proximate causes of death,

34
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:14,440
but also add some context for the clinician.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,640
The whole point of this app was to let us bring in all the information possible,

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,510
give the clinician the clearest picture that we could.

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,530
So, what we've done with this timeline is,

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,030
we've used a kind of logarithmic scaling so that we can show

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:35,800
the immediate causes and the deeper patient history all in one glance.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,680
All of the conditions on this timeline were pulled out of the medical record using FHIR

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,175
and we filtered them based on a list of valid reportable mortality conditions,

42
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:51,865
try to limit the noise and make this just as useful as we can.

43
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:56,335
So beneath the main timeline where you see the extracted conditions laid out,

44
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,825
there are also these orange timelines.

45
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:03,070
What these are, are the results of the analytic system that Paula was talking about.

46
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,840
What they are, are the proposals for possible causal pathways which

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,285
might link these conditions into a chain of events that could possibly lead to death.

48
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:15,010
When the clinician needs to change,

49
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,740
modify, or add any causes of death,

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,230
we have an area down at the bottom of the screen that's designed to

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,500
resemble the death certificate that they are already familiar with.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,440
Here, they can change any of the condition names,

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,720
correct any of the timeline issues,

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,065
and add new conditions if they need to.

55
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,710
These controls down here,

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,960
then allow the clinician to save this data

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,780
back to the medical record and complete the process.

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,890
Certainly. One of the first data sets that the students analyzed was an ontology which

59
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:55,040
is a list of known causal pathways that CDC provided to the students.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,955
And these relationships were developed by

61
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,205
the National Center for Health Statistics and

62
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:04,970
other statistical agencies across the country and

63
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,430
they're commonly used as part of the automated coding system for trying to

64
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,610
assign an international classification of disease code

65
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,545
to underlying causes of death and contributing causes of death.

66
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:23,625
That data set is important because the space that it traverses is quite large.

67
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:28,280
And so, the challenge of mapping out the network and

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,410
trying to understand how you can move from one node on the network to another,

69
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,385
was quite computationally extensive.

70
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,405
Another data set that we're analyzing,

71
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,400
is the public use data set.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,555
So the National Center for Health Statistics aggregates information

73
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:48,345
from death certificates that are collected across the country.

74
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,420
And what we have there is,

75
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,810
we have an ICD-10 coded representation of

76
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,590
what the physicians wrote on the death certificates.

77
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,314
So we've begun to apply various causal modeling actually.

78
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:06,710
So we have the information that

79
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,000
physicians actually put on death certificates and what we're beginning to do there,

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,460
is to look at what are the associations that most commonly occur.

81
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,248
And from that, we're beginning to get a much more nuanced understanding of,

82
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:23,960
what are the proper associations that

83
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,460
physicians are reporting on death certificates and where are

84
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,420
the areas where physicians may be putting things

85
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,670
in a sequence that's not actually ideologically sound.

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,350
And so, it's been very much

87
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,310
a learning process for us to be able to look at our data in this way.

88
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,090
And the third and perhaps the most exciting source of data that we're

89
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,455
analyzing in the process of building this analytical engine is that,

90
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,980
we've partnered with two of our states and they've provided

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,055
link data between the hospital discharge record and the death certificate record.

92
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,785
And this is where the students are really beginning to apply

93
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:08,600
deep learning methods to not only uncover associations,

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,830
but ultimately, causal pathways that then could be fed

95
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:20,150
back to the physician at the time that the physician is certifying the death certificate.

96
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,650
So in designing the prototype application,

97
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,810
the two most important data sets to me,

98
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,750
were the ontology containing all of

99
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,905
the valid causal relations between possible causes of death,

100
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:38,635
and the NCHS multiple causes of death data.

101
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,580
The public data that Paula was talking.

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,540
We use the ontology to filter down the conditions that we show in

103
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,290
the timeline to limit noise and make the interface more useful to the clinician.

104
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,175
We use sequential pattern mining algorithms to identify

105
00:06:56,175 --> 00:07:03,150
common temporal links between causes of death in the public causes of death data.

106
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,240
And that was what we used in the prototype application,

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,740
to propose possible linkages between one cause of death and another.

108
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,150
Basically, to try and give the clinician a sense of how

109
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,305
these might tie together in a likely way.

110
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,685
And what's so exciting about the modularity of FHIR is that,

111
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,015
the app that Ryan is developing and the team is developing,

112
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:30,390
we could start with a simple analytical engine and

113
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,895
exchange it as the understanding becomes more evolved.

114
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,830
And over time, we're hoping that we'll have more people

115
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,750
that are contributing to these analytical engines so that way,

116
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,940
we can provide the physician the most and the best information at

117
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,325
the time that they're certifying the death.

118
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:57,235
Absolutely. So we designed the application to use SMART on FHIR.

119
00:07:57,235 --> 00:08:01,995
It's a very traditional client based SMART on FHIR Javascript app,

120
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,110
that connects to the HR,

121
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,385
pulls these conditions out,

122
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:09,060
and does the filtering and display activities that I've talked about.

123
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,295
But, we also have it designed so that it can modularly be integrated with

124
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,295
additional outside servers to

125
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:20,890
provide additional services and additional functionality to the app.

126
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:26,475
Most interesting, are connections to the O-Methylisourea which we're using to

127
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:29,535
prototype code crosswalk to

128
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:33,300
try and make everything a little bit more compatible with our rule mining system,

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,055
and the actual rule mining analytics system.

130
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,705
We used a relatively simple,

131
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:43,570
sequential pattern mining technique for the initial prototype application,

132
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,176
but that is designed to be completely modular.

133
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:50,400
We want to be able to iterate on those algorithms over time,

134
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,110
improve them with use.

135
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:00,170
Well, Ryan and the team are taking the next step which is to

136
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,280
work with one of

137
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,630
the major electronic medical record vendors

138
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,775
on their SMART on FHIR app platform that they're offering.

139
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:12,110
And we have jurisdictions across the country that are

140
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,725
excited and lining up to test out the first phase of it.

141
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:20,450
That first part, will most likely not incorporate the analytical engine just so we

142
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,940
can learn the environment and get

143
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,600
some real world feedback before doing further development.

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you.
