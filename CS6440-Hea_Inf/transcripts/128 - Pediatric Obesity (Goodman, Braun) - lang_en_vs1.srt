00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,700
Dr. Aly Goodman, I'm a pediatrician and epidemiologist at CDC

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,700
in the division of Nutrition and Physical Activity and Obesity.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,530
I'm a Senior Researcher for healthcare services.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,410
And I'm Paula Braun.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,610
I'm an entrepreneur in residence with CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:35,169
The public health challenge that we're addressing is pediatric obesity.

7
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:40,580
One in three US children are living with overweight or obesity,

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,535
both of which have major health consequences,

9
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:46,355
both for children and adults.

10
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,608
These consequences can be costly,

11
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:53,400
they can cause significant disability as children age.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,410
And though, we've made some progress in public health in

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,180
terms of leveling off the prevalence or how many children have obesity,

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,030
we have a long way to go.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,235
We still have approximately 12 million children in the US living with obesity,

16
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,715
four million of whom have severe obesity.

17
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:16,445
And with that, will come a lifetime of difficulties associated with that.

18
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:22,785
So, the challenge particularly in our area and in what I work in,

19
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,960
which is really at the intersection of healthcare and public health is,

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,150
how do we help clinicians and health service providers to

21
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,065
improve the uptake of evidence-based practices for child obesity?

22
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,705
And so, that includes screening,

23
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:47,345
which is a relatively simple process of weighing

24
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:49,305
and measuring a child's height at

25
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:53,465
every well-child check that most children get at least annually,

26
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:57,155
and then calculating their body mass index,

27
00:01:57,155 --> 00:02:02,120
and plotting that on a CDC or World Health Organization growth chart,

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,430
to determine the child's percentile.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,825
And by doing that, we can determine whether a child has a healthy weight,

30
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,285
is overweight, or has obesity.

31
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:12,680
And so, in public health,

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,385
we always say the first step is screening.

33
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,835
We have to determine how many kids have a problem.

34
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,470
And then clinically speaking,

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,550
if you don't determine,

36
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,170
you don't figure out that there is a problem,

37
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,900
then you can't possibly find a solution or help the child forward.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,405
The second issue, of course,

39
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:32,700
is then preventing or treating a child's issues related to healthy weight.

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,670
And our best evidence suggests that,

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,530
when clinicians do some brief counseling on nutrition and physical activity,

42
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,285
determine whether a family is actually ready to make some changes,

43
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:45,590
and if they are,

44
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,020
offering or referring them to

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,510
a intensive pediatric weight management program, that's really multi-disciplinary,

46
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,650
it's family-oriented and typically occurs in the community and delivers

47
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,850
at least 25 hours of services over a six-month period.

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,975
So, all of those different clinical factors

49
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:09,495
can be assisted by an electronic health record

50
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:13,100
that supports the clinician in

51
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,325
making the right decisions such that you can best help the family.

52
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:24,770
In addition, the electronic health record can support program evaluation.

53
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,890
So let's say that a clinic health care system,

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,360
even a community system,

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,230
decides to do a variety of different activities to try to

56
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,945
help children or families living with overweight or obesity,

57
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,695
the data that are contained on a child's height, weight,

58
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:45,895
and body mass index in an electronic health record already are extraordinarily valuable.

59
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:50,500
So that you can look before the intervention and after the intervention and determine if

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,338
there's been any changes in the child or family's weight status.,

61
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,576
You can look at different behaviors,

62
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,115
all sorts of things.

63
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:01,180
And then lastly, electronic health records are poised to

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,035
really assist us in public health with something called surveillance,

65
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:10,646
which is the determining of how many people in a population have a particular disease.

66
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:13,555
And so, in the case of pediatric obesity,

67
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:15,335
we have national level data,

68
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:19,450
but we don't have a very good state or community level data in order to

69
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,325
provide feedback to public health programs, interventionalists, et cetera.

70
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,510
And that's where again,

71
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,495
because all these children are being seen,

72
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,950
their body mass index is being calculated,

73
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,200
is being plotted on this growth charts,

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,740
all those data are sitting in electronic health records.

75
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,860
And they could really assist us in public health and to really

76
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,010
move the needle in terms of improving child obesity.

77
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,960
Yes, it really just

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,535
started with a conversation between Dr. Goodman and myself.

79
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:57,300
Part of my role at CDC is to work with different people in

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,280
the agency and get them to experiment with and hopefully adopt these newer technologies.

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,340
And it was very apparent that the work that we were doing in

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,850
mortality could be applied across other sectors,

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,153
particularly around public health surveillance.

84
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,610
As I was showing Aly the SMART on FHIR app that had already been

85
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,535
developed to address aspects of pediatric obesity,

86
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:18,660
and we thought that,

87
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,225
that was just such a great place to start.

88
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,220
And because the code was publicly available,

89
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,945
we were able to extend it and adapt to this use case.

90
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:31,190
And so, it was more than just what happens in a clinical setting.

91
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,350
It was a recognition that childhood obesity is

92
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,295
really something that takes an entire community approach to address.

93
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:41,070
And, we imagine a world where

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,490
all of the interoperability challenges had already been solved.

95
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,655
What information would we want to provide to whom?

96
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:50,710
And what would they do with that information?

97
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,662
And over the course of the semester,

98
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:58,190
the project really took on a life of its own and it continued to evolve.

99
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,610
I think we called it the dream, right?

100
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,970
So, what's the dream which was connecting patients and providers?

101
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,890
And then having excellent care coordination that

102
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,105
then connected providers to communities, community resources,

103
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:17,175
public health and then having bi-directional flow between all of those entities

104
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:22,500
in order to sort of maximize what you're doing as a community,

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,945
in order to get better effect,

106
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:28,230
which has been shown in lots of studies to be the best way to address

107
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,935
child obesity in a community and for specific children as well.

108
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,940
The apps evolved over time. It was pretty interesting.

109
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,335
The first semester, we divided it up into four apps.

110
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,895
One that faced towards a patient,

111
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,395
another towards the provider,

112
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,645
a third towards a care coordinator,

113
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:49,200
who was really interfacing with community resources.

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,170
And then lastly, an analytics app that could

115
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,465
do some of the work that we discussed before,

116
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:59,160
regarding looking at different numbers and so looking at

117
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,324
prevalence of obesity by all kinds of different cut points,

118
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:08,335
something we do a lot in epidemiology and public health.

119
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,835
So that's how it started.

120
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:13,170
And then, I had met some providers at

121
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,845
Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and they're Strong for Life program,

122
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:20,885
which works on pediatric obesity in the Atlanta area.

123
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,270
And they had a project that they were doing with Georgia WIC,

124
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,185
the women's and children's program which

125
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:33,165
provides supplemental nutrition assistance to women and children under age five.

126
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:39,465
And, what they were doing was trying to connect pediatric primary care providers and

127
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:42,420
the WIC nutritionists and facilitate

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,545
communication through the electronic health records of both of those providers,

129
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:49,650
to see if improve communication could lead to

130
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,010
improvements in a child or family's nutritional status.

131
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,100
And so, we worked with them and started modifying

132
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,310
several of the apps that we had created for that use case,

133
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,920
which is a little bit different than the first one.

134
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,440
And then from there, we went on

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,555
to the next team of students really wanted to work on privacy and security,

136
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,215
and particularly on that patient facing app,

137
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,540
that base towards families,

138
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,160
where they could interface then or carefully work closely with their provider team.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
And then, the last most recent iteration was,

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,410
how can we integrate breastfeeding information.

141
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,485
Breastfeeding is really important for women and children.

142
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:34,085
We know that it is an important intervention for children's and women's health.

143
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:36,720
And, we also know that it can be

144
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,365
associated with healthier weight over a child's lifetime,

145
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:43,163
actually and for the mother, too, over time.

146
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:48,334
And so, integrating that information into the apps created just another,

147
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,390
it wasn't really a change in the use case, I guess,

148
00:08:51,390 --> 00:09:00,490
was more like an addition as to how can we integrate other information.

149
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,825
Sure. Here, we see the original patient-facing app.

150
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,670
It gathers information from the family directly and

151
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,695
the child's healthy habits information.

152
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,940
So specifically, in this screen,

153
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,050
what you see is a picture of fruits and vegetables.

154
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,375
We're asking the family about how many times per day the child eats fruits or vegetables.

155
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:29,665
And you can see on the bottom that the family can pick from one of five options.

156
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:35,470
So, those options and that question itself have been tested in

157
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,130
numerous clinical trials and different studies and shown to be

158
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,915
a relatively effective measure of looking at that very important information.

159
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,000
So, it helps the family not only reflect

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,745
on how they're doing in terms of fruits and vegetables,

161
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:52,300
but also that information is really critical to the provider,

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,090
because when they start discussing nutrition,

163
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,070
they know where the family starting from.

164
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,265
The next app is the provider-facing app

165
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:04,990
which is the one that was largely based on information or coding,

166
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,830
and the app that was built by Boston Children's as their growth-chart app.

167
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,150
But we were able to add some additional features that are helpful for

168
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,275
clinicians as they're tracking growth including extra data points.

169
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:23,400
Third, we have the care-coordinator app.

170
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,484
We were really impressed with this one.

171
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:34,470
The concept was that when a provider clicked on a button and sort of said,

172
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,520
"Please refer this family to community resources," the app could take

173
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,403
the information from the electronic health record on the patient or families address,

174
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:50,500
and then map community resources that were nearby their home.

175
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,020
And so, in this app,

176
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,350
you can see they developed a map that could show

177
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,425
the family where a variety of resources to support

178
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,920
healthy eating and active living were relative to where the family lives.

179
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,350
So here, you see nutrition support resources including the Tower Grove Farmer's Market,

180
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,505
and different markets, and community supported agriculture spot.

181
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:19,410
In addition, this app allowed secure messaging

182
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,325
between community resources and the provider.

183
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,435
Because as a provider,

184
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,335
very often when we refer families to community resources,

185
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,050
it's sort of a black box.

186
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,810
We make the referral, but then we have no idea

187
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,535
whether they've gotten there, what happens there.

188
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:42,105
And we try to ask families and find out how things are going.

189
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:46,170
Very often, the visits that we have with families as clinicians are very short.

190
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,435
It's very difficult to get all the information.

191
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:51,330
So, it's quite helpful to have that information ahead of time,

192
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,310
be able to look at it before you walk in to see the family.

193
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,060
And so, here you can see this combined inbox that

194
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,245
allows a care coordinator to see, "Oh, look.

195
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:04,120
This family went to the Farmer's Market.

196
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,390
They completed a questionnaire for the doctor.

197
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,325
They actually did get to the YMCA and scheduled an appointment."

198
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:17,060
And so, picking up as a clinician from that information and moving forward with

199
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,980
the family is just a much more efficient way

200
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,510
of providing prevention and treatment options.

201
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,480
Lastly, you see here a screenshot of the analytics app.

202
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,380
And the concept here is that it's taking information on some sort of population,

203
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,560
whether that's the population of patients that the physicians sees,

204
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,555
or within a practice group,

205
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,845
or even larger health-care system.

206
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:46,490
And it's combining that information on lots of kids,

207
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,310
and then slicing and dicing it in all different ways.

208
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,385
And so here, we've got some charts on blood pressure amongst the population, weight,

209
00:12:55,385 --> 00:13:02,567
and BMI, and you can display that in different formats.

210
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:06,404
FHIR was an essential part of this project,

211
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:09,810
especially in thinking about potential scalability issues.

212
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,080
FHIR presents a common way of fetching information from the electronic health record.

213
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,560
It also provides through,

214
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,030
the SMART on FHIR platform,

215
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,755
the ability to add functionality to electronic medical records that didn't exist before.

216
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:25,410
Aly spent a lot of time talking about

217
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,040
the Boston Children's app that we modified for this project.

218
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,225
But the other apps also could be SMART on FHIR projects.

219
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,475
So, the patient-facing app,

220
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,550
the care-coordinator pacing app.

221
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,175
And FHIR provided the lingua franca,

222
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:43,365
that just allowed everything to be able to communicate with one another and ensure that

223
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,290
the information went where it needed to go and that people

224
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,200
had it at their fingertips when they were making critical decisions.

225
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,842
Well, this is an exciting project that has evolved.

226
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,775
And as I understand, it will continue to evolve

227
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,565
in future variations in the class.

228
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,010
So, thank you both for taking the time to come here today and talk about it.

229
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,160
Thank you.

230
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,780
Thank you.

231
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Anything else?

232
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
I think we got plenty.

233
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,840
Do we want future iterations?

234
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,810
You had said you wanted that but do you not?

235
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:10,981
We can do it.

236
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,475
Do you have a sense of where it's going at?

237
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,230
Since we're sitting here.

238
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah, we might as well do it.

239
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,486
So, that would be?

240
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:16,300
That would be Aly.

241
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,173
Yeah.

242
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,650
So Aliy, this project has gone through several iterations.

243
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,390
I understand you have still more for the future.

244
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,945
Can you tell us a bit about that?

245
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:31,790
Sure. We're really excited to keep developing these technologies.

246
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,575
We actually got to showcase some of these recently at the Hymns 2017 Conference.

247
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:42,230
And we were flabbergasted quite frankly by their response,

248
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,000
and how excited clinician's,

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,765
public health professionals, and health-care executives were,

250
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:54,110
to actually see clinical apps that were dealing with a very prevalent problem,

251
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,610
solving so many issues regarding communication,

252
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,710
clinical decision support, analytics,

253
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,290
population health, all of that.

254
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,195
And so based on that excitement,

255
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:11,570
we are next going to hopefully partner with some academic researchers who

256
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,780
really are absolute experts in the field of

257
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,530
clinical decision supports for pediatric obesity.

258
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,450
And these are clinical decisions supports that have been

259
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,925
tested in multiple research studies.

260
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,910
It have shown to be effective.

261
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,730
So, we're going to go back to our apps,

262
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,285
go back to our code,

263
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:32,750
and sort of re-adapt and reinvent those

264
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,815
clinical decision supports to be in line with what these researchers are working on,

265
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:40,150
with the hope that

266
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,040
the researchers will be able to actually

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,310
implement them in real clinics with real families,

268
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,595
and test whether those supports through the apps actually lead to a change in behaviors,

269
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:56,740
or weight status for children, or their families.

270
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,998
I'm glad we asked that question.

271
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:57,999
Yup.

272
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,620
Now I think we're done.

273
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,450
Okay. That's all that you get condensed to 10 minutes.
