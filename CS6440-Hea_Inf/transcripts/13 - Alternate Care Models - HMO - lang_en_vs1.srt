1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,925
Are there examples of a better approach?

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:07,310
Yes. Earlier I mentioned health maintenance organizations.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,310
And we'll now look at the oldest.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,440
Kaiser Permanente was founded in 1945 by

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,175
industrialists Henry J. Kaiser and physician Sidney R. Garfield.

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:26,425
Edgar Kaiser famously described its economic model as "The less Kaiser does for patients,

7
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,265
the more money it makes."

8
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:34,600
This is because Kaiser offers a prepaid plan to employers.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,500
Kaiser agrees to provide all needed care for a fixed amount per year.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,695
The history actually dates to 1933,

11
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:49,590
when Garfield opened the Contractors General Hospital with 12 beds to

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,670
treat construction workers building the Los Angeles aqueduct in the Mojave Desert.

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,660
The hospital was in a precarious financial state.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,145
Fueled by Garfield's desire to treat all patients regardless of their ability to pay.

15
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,155
Harold Hatch, an insurance agent,

16
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,030
proposed that the insurance companies pay the hospital

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,255
a total amount in advance for each worker covered.

18
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:19,590
The financial relationship between the insurance companies and the hospital was

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,895
efficient and allowed Garfield to focus on a new idea, preventative health care.

20
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,596
This is the first key takeaway.

21
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:32,729
When the health care economic model provides the right incentives,

22
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,210
the focus shifts to preventive care in order to avoid costs.

23
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,113
Kaiser is also a leader in care coordination and population health,

24
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:48,830
two key strategies for managing chronic disease that we'll discuss later on.

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,365
To support these strategies,

26
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:55,855
Kaiser has also been a leader in the use of information technology.

27
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,650
HIMSS is a large,

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:04,420
not-for-profit organization, focused on better health through information technology.

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,175
Its annual meeting is by far,

30
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,610
the largest event in the field.

31
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,680
In 2009, Kaiser received the first ever Stage 7 award.

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,080
This is HIMSS' highest level of recognition for

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,970
an environment where paper charts are no longer used.

34
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,135
That's the second key takeaway.

35
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,180
A care models that work best for

36
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,725
chronic disease rest on the use of information technology.

37
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:33,990
Kaiser's done well.

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,300
And today, it employs 186,000 staff and over

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,580
18,000 physicians to serve over 10 million patients in these areas.
