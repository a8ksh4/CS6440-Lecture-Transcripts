1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,665
Thank you, it's an honor to be here.

2
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:08,855
My name is Mason Beard,

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:12,893
and I run Product Strategy and Marketing for Philips,

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,950
and specifically, the Population Health Management Business.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,820
And I am Philip Burgher,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,640
and I am the director of Software Development for Data Platforms.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,335
All right, so briefly, it's going to be

8
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:30,245
a little bit of challenge, but I'll do my best.

9
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:34,360
So in 2005, I helped start a company with my brother-in-law,

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,200
who is an internal medicine physician,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,430
and the company was Wellcentive.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,760
It was purchased by Philips about a year ago.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,330
And back then, we started our first population health management focused-business.

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,575
And I know from this course,

15
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:53,005
you've been learning about switching from pay for procedure, volume-based billing, etc.

16
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:58,525
to more of a quality-based pay for performance healthcare delivery model.

17
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:03,205
And in 2005, we learned that there was a commercial plan,

18
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,550
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, that was paying on quality.

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,665
The other thing that we quickly learned is that

20
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:12,275
health systems are very confusing organizations.

21
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,598
So it's made up of certain doctor relationships,

22
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:17,760
some are employed, some are affiliated,

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,950
that means the affiliated using a ton of different EHRs.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,830
So at first, we realized that nobody is really solving this problem,

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,970
nobody's focused on helping doctors prove their quality,

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,645
and the people that were doing it before us, the payers,

27
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:33,055
it created a lot of static,

28
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,660
because the data quality issues,

29
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,620
and there was not a lot of trust in that data.

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,540
And so, we saw a business opportunity,

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,000
first identifying the problem, then creating the solution.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,235
From 2005 onto today,

33
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:49,270
if you think about what's happened to move from fee for service

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,413
to quality from the ACA to ACOs,

35
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,235
every acronym under the sun,

36
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,790
we've continued to grow as basically organizations

37
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,450
switch from fee for service-minded billing and tracking,

38
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,810
to more around quality.

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,540
That's actually really easy,

40
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,548
I don't know why anybody else can't do it.

41
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,325
No, it's been very challenging.

42
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,975
I've been in this game for over a decade now,

43
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,690
and the term that we've been

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,005
using for a long time when it comes to the state of the data,

45
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:25,390
when it comes to health care is the Wild Wild West,

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,385
and that is still very true.

47
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:32,875
There's been lots of talk and movement at a policy level about

48
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:38,120
getting everybody on to a same standard when it comes to formats or coding systems.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,590
But the truth of the matter is that as of today,

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,875
55% of our data is still local or custom code sets.

51
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:50,345
And so, it's really still quite the challenge.

52
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:55,030
You have to kind of build a foundation of the house or the pyramid,

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,660
or whatever structure you want to talk about to make it possible to

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,860
do all of the population health analytics that everybody is talking about these days.

55
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,850
So kind of the first step is just getting the data.

56
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,690
There are political and technical challenges there.

57
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,855
You have to be flexible,

58
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,880
that's been our philosophy.

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,075
Once you have the data,

60
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,850
you have to make sure that it's high quality,

61
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:21,410
and there's all sorts of very deep rabbit holes that we can go into there.

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,230
And then finally, once you have all that,

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,248
and everything's kind of in one place,

64
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,454
and scrubbed, and consistent,

65
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,990
then you can start really doing the cool stuff,

66
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,295
which is the measurements,

67
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:35,920
the machine learning, where you can really start improving health care.

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,090
One of my favorite quotes is,

69
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,640
"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."

70
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,660
We're to the point where we can measure it,

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,890
and everybody's trying to figure out how you can improve it.

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,470
Yes, the data aggregation is definitely the what,

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,175
and the mechanism, but the why is payment reform.

74
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,285
They're being paid differently.

75
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,383
It's not a volume-based business anymore.

76
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:04,835
And everything that you do as risk is shifted.

77
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,730
And I know you've learned about this in

78
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,730
your course that payers are shifting risk to the providers.

79
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,920
So the one dollar that they could spend,

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,855
they're looking at making sure that they have high quality,

81
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,850
health care delivery, and watching the cost.

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,625
So we really think about it.

83
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,465
And I have some slide here to show you that

84
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:26,270
we think about the problems we're trying to solve now is four.

85
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,320
They have a quality problem,

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,730
so they're looking at the quality of the services they deliver,

87
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,910
because that's how the payment is going be tied to. They have a revenue problem.

88
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,575
They have, as we say,

89
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,004
a foot in two canoes.

90
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:40,705
They have to have a fee for service foot in that canoe,

91
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,610
and they're slowly putting their weight into

92
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,405
a value-based care canoe as bundle payments come around,

93
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:49,570
MIPS, macro reporting requirements,

94
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,300
ACO contracts, risk-bearing contracts, etc.

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,030
They're learning to basically shift the revenue.

96
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,370
They also have a market issue.

97
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,445
Patients are becoming consumers.

98
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,335
They're not patients anymore, they are customers,

99
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:07,600
and they're used to shopping on Amazon and looking for the best value they can.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,148
So you have to think about that,

101
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:11,125
those patients in your area as a market,

102
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,450
and how to continue to grow that market.

103
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,285
And the last piece is access.

104
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:17,770
Right now, if you look at traditional healthcare delivery,

105
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,763
patients are receiving care in the wrong place.

106
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,980
And what I mean by that is the most expensive place.

107
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,205
So they're looking at solving those problems from an access perspective,

108
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,040
not going to the ER, but maybe talking

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,235
to a care manager or being routed back to a primary care office.

110
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,890
It's a lot cheaper, better patient satisfaction,

111
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:42,974
and many times higher quality.

112
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,210
I wish there was an easy button, right?

113
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,590
And I guess you wish there was an easy button as well,

114
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,270
on the tech side.

115
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,652
That's true.

116
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:54,377
There is no switch that says we're going to do population health management now,

117
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:57,410
insert two keys in the basement of hospital and turn it, right?

118
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,060
So if you look at the graph I have up here,

119
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,410
is we look at this as a transformation.

120
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,025
Your every health system in the United States is on a journey,

121
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:09,085
and essentially, they're moving from left to right.

122
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,950
So if you look here at the bottom of this graph,

123
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,835
we've got different payment models going from the far left, you have fee for service.

124
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:18,585
Moving all the way as risk is shifting to those health care organizations,

125
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,960
you're moving to the far right.

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,495
As you grow in this model,

127
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:23,638
and as you transform,

128
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:26,220
there are certain competencies that you have to

129
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,475
master before going to the next stage, if you will.

130
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:32,685
So just quickly, if you're on the left -side of this model,

131
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,325
you have a understanding problem.

132
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,614
You need to aggregate the data,

133
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:39,495
baseline your performance of clinical and financial measures,

134
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:42,690
and just understand where kind of due north is.

135
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,210
When you move over to the right hand side of the model,

136
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,880
you're going to start to do.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,260
And we feel like the first thing that you're going to

138
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,870
start to do to affect the population,

139
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,540
is going to be care navigation.

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,360
You want to start steering patients to a higher quality,

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,645
lower cost center, not the ER, but the PCP office.

142
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:04,570
Maybe deploying telehealth or mHealth.

143
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,200
The last stage of this is going to be more activation.

144
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,240
And I'm sure, in this course,

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,315
you've learned about patient engagement,

146
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:16,860
ways that you can basically empower patients to take control of their health.

147
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,910
We feel like that that comes after an understanding of the data,

148
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,875
after you've started to master some of these navigation techniques,

149
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:29,293
and then you can get into deep, deep engagement.

150
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:32,800
So it's a deep topic, steerage.

151
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,910
So healthcare systems want to make sure that patients stay in network.

152
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,945
And health care plans have things called narrow networks,

153
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:43,850
essentially define which doctors you need to see.

154
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,300
When I talk about access and navigation,

155
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm saying that you're going to the right doctor,

156
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,515
but you're also going to the right care center.

157
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:57,700
So many problems health care systems have is over utilization of ER,

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,825
and it's an access problem, right?

159
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:02,470
So you've learned in this course about PCMH models,

160
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,765
where they have extended hours,

161
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:06,465
weekend hours, you can actually go to your primary care.

162
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,855
That's because it's higher quality and lower cost.

163
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,575
So access and navigating patients

164
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,325
is a whole domain that fits into population health management.

165
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,515
That is that first step in doing,

166
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,510
once you get the data, and have that understanding.

167
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,220
And I think ER utilization is a great example of kind of

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,010
a low-hanging fruit when it comes to population health,

169
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,715
because the data requirements for that are pretty simple.

170
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:35,245
If you can get an ADTV from your hospital network,

171
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,570
most hospitals can do a push notification

172
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,470
for when a patient presents themselves in the ER,

173
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,270
integrate the longitudinal chart, all of a sudden,

174
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,615
you have an event that you can queue to kick off the rest of that process.

175
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:52,420
What's really cool that we're seeing more and

176
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,380
more of in the industry is that's a very reactive process.

177
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,005
How do you become more proactive?

178
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,300
How do you keep them out of the ER in the first place?

179
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,960
And that's where you get things like social determinants of health,

180
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,780
machine learning, clustering of patients.

181
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,868
Risk stratification.

182
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:12,190
Risk stratification. When you

183
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,400
ask about the how and how you actually start to move the needle,

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,295
there's a very interesting corollary of

185
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:22,660
the maturity from the network governance point of view,

186
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,440
and the data implication as well.

187
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,300
Yes.

188
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,000
Sure. Yes, our machine learning is very tightly

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,205
integrated with our data quality philosophy as well in

190
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:43,665
that the machine learning is kind of shoring up at

191
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:49,100
a programmatic level the poor data quality that we see in a lot of charts.

192
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,640
One of the main challenges with identifying your high risk patients

193
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,440
is how do you do that at scale with that data,

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,575
and that's where machine learning can help a lot.

195
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:03,380
So, we've applied algorithms that look for data that is missing

196
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,750
from one chart because it's similar to

197
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,595
this chart and this chart has a confirmed diagnosis.

198
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,290
We're using social determinants of health to try and figure out

199
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,430
whether there's a corollary between this population and that population.

200
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,715
So are you sure this patient isn't diabetic?

201
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:18,860
Things like that nature.

202
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,910
And I think what's important in what Philip's saying is,

203
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,265
is if you think kind of back to that model of maturity and transformation,

204
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:28,010
what Philip's talking about is getting very proactive.

205
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,520
When you're doing predictive analytics and predicting who's at risk for

206
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,970
a hospital stay where one of those lower level skills after you aggregate the data is,

207
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,240
okay, we get an ADT feed from the hospital that a patient was admitted,

208
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,570
now let's signal a care manager to call in to make sure they get connected.

209
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,205
That's kind of after the fact, right?

210
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:50,620
So, what Philip is talking about is the next step and it's definitely a higher level of

211
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,445
maturity on their ability because they've gotten from reactive to proactive,

212
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,580
and they're doing that because they're at risk for these patients and the cost.

213
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,640
Yes, and you think about the earlier you can detect the problem,

214
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,140
the less expensive it is.

215
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,255
Absolutely.

216
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,950
And so, before the ER,

217
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,955
there is the doctor visit.

218
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:11,145
And if you really want to get out there a little bit before there's the doctor visit,

219
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,570
there's the data that can be collected outside of the office

220
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:22,040
where mHealth comes in.

221
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,331
Yes, I think both of us can.

222
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:26,450
But yes, it's really an interesting evolution where we went

223
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,195
from payers using claims data to basically determine quality,

224
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,820
to now we were talking about EHR data,

225
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,440
HIT data in general.

226
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,790
This is a new era, so we're bringing in social data.

227
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,780
One of the things that we like to quote is that your zip code is probably

228
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,900
the most important data point for determining your health and your risk score.

229
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,050
The other thing that we've learned over the years is

230
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,185
that credit score can be extremely powerful in determining medication adherence.

231
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,210
So if somebody that has a higher credit score,

232
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,280
they're going to be more apt to follow doctor's orders and to be managing

233
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:11,585
their medications as prescribed.

234
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:13,280
Sure, it's a great question.

235
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,990
There's a lot of talk around FHIR but the reality of the situation is

236
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,160
that we don't see a whole lot of it in the real world.

237
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,960
And I think the nature of that is just that the use case of FHIR,

238
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,870
it was designed for taking care of a patient one at a time, small data sets.

239
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,325
And when you're talking about data at the population level,

240
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:40,485
the mechanisms involved in FHIR just don't really scale that well,

241
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:44,665
specifically the query retrieve method of interoperability.

242
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:49,170
If you think about it from a agnostic aggregators point of view,

243
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,900
there's no event for us to reach out and pull down information.

244
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,420
That's kind of like a giant game of Marco Polo to figure

245
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,605
out where the patient is presented out in the community and let's go get that data.

246
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,020
So from creating the longitudinal chart,

247
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,115
we don't see a whole lot of traction there.

248
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:10,650
However, where we do see a lot of hope is kind of on the flip side.

249
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,205
Once we've gotten the data any which way we can,

250
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,220
we've done all the analytics,

251
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,855
we've created the quality artifacts,

252
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,370
a challenge that we've had is workflow.

253
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,795
The people who need to see that data are in the EMR.

254
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,200
They will have one tool,

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,100
there's been problems galore with adopting those tools and they're like,

256
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,520
"I've finally got my EMR to the point where it's usable.

257
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Don't make me use something else."

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,550
Totally understandable.

259
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,710
And that's where we think FHIR can help a lot because it's

260
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,905
a standard way to get data back into their workflow.

261
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,410
We've actually had a lot of

262
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,040
conversations internally and with the standards organizations about,

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,355
this is what we see is the population that use case for FHIR.

264
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:54,150
So, if I could, I just want to throw one thing in here and maybe it's

265
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,395
just to provoke some thoughts for the members here in this class is,

266
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:01,835
this use case is very encounter-based.

267
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:05,520
I have a patient that I know needs to be in front of a doctor and I'm going to optimize

268
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,650
that visit leveraging a different technology that pulls in longitudinal data.

269
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,820
What happens when that encounter or we blur the lines of an encounter,

270
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,404
what is Telehealth? What is mHealth?

271
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:20,975
What is continuous monitoring?

272
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:25,590
Right? So, the use case that Philip just laid out there is real.

273
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,790
That's what we're tackling today.

274
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,115
But when you think about where healthcare is going,

275
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,930
that line of an encounter,

276
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,245
that activity is going to blur.

277
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,310
And that's kind of the next frontier that we're going to have to tackle.

278
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:43,770
The patient engagement piece,

279
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,505
the patient activation piece,

280
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,625
getting them more in charge of their health and

281
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,400
interactive with technologies is absolutely the next frontier.

282
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,985
I think that it's pretty ahead of the market when you think about that right now,

283
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,760
because I personally feel that we are trying to engage

284
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,580
physicians right now into a new world and they're still

285
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,130
grumpy about their fee for service revenue being

286
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,630
cut and they're trying to learn a new way of doing business.

287
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,130
But absolutely, the next chapter is engaging

288
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,190
patients and if FHIR is supporting this type of protocols,

289
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,825
that's absolutely where it needs to go.

290
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,835
Yes, that's a great point because when it comes to consumers,

291
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,715
everybody has a smartphone and everybody knows how to

292
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:28,090
use an application and that is what FHIR is designed for.

293
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,705
I get that question a lot because people, I think,

294
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:38,550
generally think of Philips as an industrial company but we've been in

295
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,195
healthcare since 1918 and have been very innovative.

296
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:47,010
And I look at kind of the old world of hospital

297
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,322
systems being the center of the universe and Philips has had a lot of hardware,

298
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,680
CT scanners, MRI scanners,

299
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,565
patient monitoring systems that are inside the hospital.

300
00:15:56,565 --> 00:16:00,240
But where Philips really is growing is in

301
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,100
the health tech and getting outside of

302
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,650
that hospital from a patient engagement perspective,

303
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,250
from home Telehealth to mobile apps to wellness.

304
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,185
And then from a Wellcentive perspective,

305
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,120
we give context to that.

306
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,840
So Philips has a big footprint and a big footprint means a lot of

307
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,770
data that really goes outside of just a hospital and with now,

308
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,240
Wellcentive, we apply context to that data for value-based care.

309
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,470
And the other thing,

310
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,631
and Philip touched on this when we were talking about FHIR,

311
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:33,180
is there is a DNA to HIT systems and,

312
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,575
not to go down that road,

313
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:37,305
but EMR's have a certain DNA.

314
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:41,310
They were built to schedule and bill in a fee-for-service world.

315
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,330
Philips plus Wellcentive is,

316
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,505
I will call, an agnostic aggregator.

317
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,390
They can sit across the health system,

318
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,435
across many EMR's and pull that data.

319
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:55,035
There's a lot of power in being the agnostic aggregator

320
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:58,615
and helping these use cases out where there's a lot of limitations

321
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:08,625
if you kind of come from that episodic DNA, if you will.

322
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,670
Thank you. It's a pleasure.

323
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,130
Yes. Thanks very much.
