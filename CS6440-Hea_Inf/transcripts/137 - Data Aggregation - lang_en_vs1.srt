00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,685
Obtaining and aggregating health data presents many domain specific challenges.

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:09,520
Think back to earlier in the course when we discussed

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,720
HIPAA and the protection of patient privacy as

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,350
well as obtaining patient permissions for the use of

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,435
their data unless it is fully de-Identified.

6
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:23,935
However, depending on the use case,

7
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:29,310
fool the identification can substantially reduce the value of the data.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,835
Where genomic data is involved,

9
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:37,920
the identification may not be feasible if that data is to have any research value.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,535
Even with patient permissions,

11
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:43,505
all the interoperability issues we discussed

12
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:48,125
earlier can be impediments to aggregating data for research.

13
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,040
These include the reluctance of hospitals and

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,510
other sources of clinical data to lose control of it.

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,365
Without semantic interoperability, and it is still rare,

16
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,920
data from multiple sources must often be normalized

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,723
to a standard model to be useful for analysis.

18
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:10,310
Earlier, John Duke discussed

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,700
the Federated Research Model and the use of

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,236
the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership,

21
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:22,785
OMOP, data model across a research network to solve many of these issues.

22
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:29,000
We will talk with John about the tools to analyze data that is in the OMOP model.
