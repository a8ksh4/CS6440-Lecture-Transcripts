00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
A large part of Kaiser's success is because it's concentrated in

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,920
a few areas where it has the market presence to own and operate all,

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,075
or most of its facilities and employ its physicians.

4
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:21,165
Can smaller care organizations deliver the kind of care that Kaiser provides?

5
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:24,660
Many feel the patient-centered medical home,

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,640
or PCMH, provides for this.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,555
The concept dates to the early 1960s.

8
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:36,145
In fact, I worked in an early example of the PCMH,

9
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,020
where I oversaw the development of one of

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,945
the first electronic medical records systems starting around 1970.

11
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:48,409
The PCMH model is advocated by the American College of Physicians,

12
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:55,445
or ACP, which is the professional organization for internal medicine doctors.

13
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:59,663
It's also supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians,

14
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:06,230
or AAFP, the other large professional association of primary care physicians.

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,580
This is because their members are the doctors on

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,335
the front lines of managing chronic disease.

17
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:16,175
The ACP describes the PCMH as,

18
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,810
"A care delivery model whereby patient treatment is coordinated through

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,930
their primary care physician to ensure they

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,485
receive the necessary care when and where they need it,

21
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,535
in a manner they can understand."

22
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:32,930
The objective is to have a centralized setting that facilitates

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,700
partnerships between individual patients and their personal physicians,

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,080
and when appropriate, for patients' family.

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,250
Care is facilitated by registries,

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,080
information technology, health information exchange,

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,800
and other means to assure that patients get the indicated care,

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,230
when and where they need and want it

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,080
in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,025
Note again, in this graphic from the AAFP,

31
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,800
the emphasis is on providing all needed

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,090
care and using information technology to manage that.
