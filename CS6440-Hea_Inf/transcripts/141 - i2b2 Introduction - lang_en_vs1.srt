00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,003
Informatics for integrating biology and the bedside, i2b2,

2
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:12,010
is an NIH funded effort based at Partners Healthcare System in Boston.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,060
Its mission is to enable clinical investigators to conduct

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,980
research using state of the art genomics and biomedical informatics.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,155
i2b2 supports complex clinical research environments.

6
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:32,580
But it provides an easily understood database schema that can be used to create

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,525
a data warehouse where

8
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:41,990
large clinical abstracts from an enterprise EHR can be stored for future analysis.

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,470
This is important because the database schema of

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,095
commercial enterprise EHR can be dauntingly complex,

11
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:57,030
proprietary and not necessarily designed well to support ad hoc queries.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,550
As shown here, i2b2 implementations are comprised of cells

13
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,755
that communicate via web services and in aggregate form in i2b2 hive.

14
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:15,230
The role of most of these cells should be clear from their names.

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,280
Custom cells can be added to the hive and there is

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,420
an organized i2b2 users group to share information

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,660
and applications and to create the potential for

18
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,110
research collaboration and federated queries across institutions.

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:38,660
Here, you see the addition of a fire cell to support smart and fhir apps running against

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:46,950
the data in the i2b2 instance. All right, just keep going.
