1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,970
My name is Shamim Nemati.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,200
I'm an assistant professor of

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,410
biomedical informatics here at the Emory School of Medicine.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,330
Prior to coming to Emory,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,590
I was a Ph.D. student at MIT where I worked on

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,810
developing algorithms for early prediction of success using the MIMIC database,

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,859
which is the world's largest critical care public data set available.

8
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,780
This data set was developed over a period of 10 years using

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,415
the data from the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital Critical Care Center.

10
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:40,840
And my intention was to build predictive analytic algorithms that can catch

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,313
sepsis ahead of time.

12
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,325
So sepsis is related to

13
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:53,960
blood infection and is the number one killer of people in the ICU.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,125
Every year around 750,000 people they

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,510
die in the intensive care unit due to consequences of sepsis,

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,970
with the annual cost of over 20 billion dollars.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,750
If you want to break it down it turns out regular individuals who go to

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,755
ICU they may stay there for 45 hours or so,

19
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:16,080
versus for septic patients they may stay in the ICU for over 110 hours.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,180
So this added length of a stay in the ICU is one of

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:26,520
the causes for increase in costs associated with sepsis.

22
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:35,155
I developed these algorithms at MIT using the MIMIC database and when I came to Emory,

23
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,324
I wanted to validate these algorithms using the Emory data.

24
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:41,165
So I went to the clinical data warehouse here at Emory,

25
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:43,450
that is a database that is built on

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,870
Emory patients and I asked the question, "do you have the data?"

27
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,937
And they said, "yes."

28
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,880
So I got the data and I right away noticed that the data format is very

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,985
different from the data that I had previously from the MIMIC database.

30
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:59,485
So I spent the next nine months cleaning up the data

31
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:03,357
and put it in the right format for my algorithms to use.

32
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,720
Right away I realized that,

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,920
that would not be practical in general.

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,930
Then I decided to build a similar algorithms for real time data and I

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,340
realized that I had to do the same thing with the epic and [inaudible] electronic medical records.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,690
That's when I started talking to

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,445
the Georgia Tech team and I described my problem to them and we

38
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:22,930
together we decided to build

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,100
a FHIR based sepsis prediction algorithm and that was the beginning of our collaboration.

40
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,833
Yes.

41
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:38,050
So the app is called sepsis watch and it was built in

42
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,685
association with the Georgia Tech CS44O students during their spring semester of 2017.

43
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:47,165
Let me actually show it to you.

44
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,880
So the idea of this app is to build

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,255
a predictive analytic algorithm for early prediction of sepsis.

46
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,690
However the problem that we have,

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,960
is that for data elements to end up in

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,630
their patients electronic medical record for us to use it,

49
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,926
a clinician should order these labs to begin with.

50
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,965
Let's focus on an example lets say lactate.

51
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:13,285
It turns out lactate is important for prediction of sepsis.

52
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,155
But if a clinician doesn't order

53
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,050
the lactate test then you don't have the lab test to make the prediction.

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,810
So the first part of this application was to create

55
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,510
visualization for clinicians for most important lab values,

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,905
as well as one a step ahead prediction for the labs.

57
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:36,050
If the lab value in the future is larger,

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,045
higher than a critical value,

59
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:42,350
then the clinician may decide to order a new lab test or decide to

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,842
use the lab test value in the context of a predictive analytic algorithm.

61
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,385
If you know that the patient is at risk for sepsis,

62
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:54,590
using these lab values we can project ahead and we can make a prediction of our sepsis.

63
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,760
Sure.

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,015
So here is where FHIR actually is very, very important.

65
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:11,530
So the first step was to reformat data to make it in a FHIR compatible format.

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,465
This allows us to use the same algorithms that we developed for the

67
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:19,873
Emory data and the sepsis data to apply it to the data that we get here.

68
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,895
With the help of FHIR,

69
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,900
we map the data elements to a set of meta data that are also

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,195
known as the fire resources.These fire resources they become the input,

71
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:34,795
our predictive analytic algorithm for prediction of sepsis.

72
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:40,428
Once this step is taken care of as a next step we use the FHIR,

73
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:45,485
a sort of FHIR platform to create visualizations for the clinicians.

74
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,190
So in this case the visualizations involved explain

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,420
the current and future values of the labs as well as

76
00:04:52,420 --> 00:05:01,975
risk values for prediction of our prediction of sepsis.

77
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:06,300
One of the nice thing about working with the students was that some of them they were

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
very good on the back end and front

79
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,935
end developments with the servers and the smart on FHIR.

80
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,140
Some of them were experienced in machine learning.

81
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,140
So they tried a number of different algorithms and we

82
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,755
settled on a cox proportional hazard model that

83
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:23,190
aims to look at the patient data at the current time and make

84
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,070
predictions for sepsis up to six hours ahead of time.

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,515
With the use of this method we were able to achieve

86
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:33,015
a very high level of sensitivity and specificity.

87
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:39,460
As I recall the AUC of the model was around .85 at the level of 85 percent sensitivity.

88
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,610
Which means if you want to catch 85 percent of septic patients

89
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,515
their specificity was around 0.75,

90
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:48,960
which means around like 25 percent false alarm.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,435
This is really remarkable.

92
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,788
That's why we're very excited about taking it to

93
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,960
the next step and having a clinical implementation of this algorithm.

94
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,170
Here at Emory we

95
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,625
have the privilege of working with very sharp and motivated clinicians.

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,370
Our director of critical care Dr. Buchman is

97
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,555
a huge supporter of this type of applications.

98
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm currently working with him and

99
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,115
his team to come up with a clinical implementation of this.

100
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:23,910
So as a first step what we are planning to do is to hire some of

101
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,497
the Georgia Tech students to implement their app on our electronic medical record.

102
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:33,780
Once the app is in place within the context of our electronic medical record,

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,245
then we would need to run the application in the so called silent mode.

104
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:41,310
What it means is that you run the algorithm in

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,495
the background without actually influencing clinical decision making.

106
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:49,895
So since here you're dealing with prediction task,

107
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,470
the algorithm runs in the background and

108
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,350
gathers the statistics and the statistics tells us how

109
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,690
often the algorithm is able to detect sepsis before the clinicians.

110
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,750
Once that part is done and we can show that in

111
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,610
a real time setting the algorithm can detect sepsis before clinicians,

112
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,005
then we will be in the right setting for proposing

113
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:15,205
a clinical trial to show it in a more randomized setting.

114
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:17,740
So that's the next step of our work.

115
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,390
But the FHIR goes beyond this type of validation works.

116
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,370
We have a number of active collaborations with other teams across the country.

117
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,868
They have their own algorithms.

118
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:32,322
They want to verify and validate their algorithms on our data and vice versa.

119
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:38,285
FHIR gives us a common language for data exchange and collaboration.

120
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,500
And I think this is the way of.
