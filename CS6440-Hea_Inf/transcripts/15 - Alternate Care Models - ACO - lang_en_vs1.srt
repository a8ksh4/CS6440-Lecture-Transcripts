00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Earlier we mentioned that healthcare in the US was

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,269
traditionally charged based on the amount of care that was delivered.

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:10,988
This is usually termed pay for procedures.

4
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:16,135
HMOs are an example of an alternate model in which there is fixed reimbursement.

5
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:20,800
So if Kaiser spends less than its premium income it makes a profit.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
In fact, like most nonprofits,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,205
Kaiser still needs earnings to invest in its business.

8
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:30,985
However, this relies on Kaiser employing all the physicians,

9
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:33,480
owning all the hospitals and more.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,050
Can we create something similar on a much smaller scale using physicians,

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,565
hospitals, and other community health resources that are already in place?

12
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:48,990
In 2006, Dartmouth professor, Elliott S. Fisher,

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,550
first used the term accountable care organization to describe such a proposed solution.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,550
The details are complex but the basic idea is to create

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,290
a financial model under which existing community providers can organize and deliver

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,280
care in a way that improves the quality and lowers the cost of

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,235
care by fostering greater accountability

18
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,510
on the part of the providers for their performance.

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,350
One of the key provisions of

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,375
the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act was the creation of ACOs within Medicare.

21
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:27,270
This model is also now widely advocated by commercial health insurance companies.
