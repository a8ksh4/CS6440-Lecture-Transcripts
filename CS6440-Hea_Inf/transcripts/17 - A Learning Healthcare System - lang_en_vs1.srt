1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So far we've talked mostly about the role of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,235
Health Informatics to improve the delivery of care.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:12,755
What about its role in ensuring we deliver the right care to every patient, every time?

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:16,085
This is a major concern of the Academy of Medicine,

5
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:18,975
which is the new name for the Institute of Medicine.

6
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:22,490
It recognizes that we are entering a new era of

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,420
medical science that offers the prospect of personalized health care.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,180
It also recognizes that physicians and patients must deal with

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,020
an increasingly complex array of health care options and decisions,

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,695
and they need help to choose wisely.

11
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,540
That help in turn,

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,505
may require new knowledge about what works and when and for whom it works.

13
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:50,685
To achieve that, years ago IOM called for a learning health care system.

14
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,660
That it describes as a sustainable system that gets

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,330
the right care for people when they need it

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,440
and then captures the results for further improvement.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,340
In simple terms, we need to gather data from care already delivered,

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,490
aggregated, and analyze it to learn from

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,990
the collective results of many care representatives.

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,260
We need a feedback cycle.
