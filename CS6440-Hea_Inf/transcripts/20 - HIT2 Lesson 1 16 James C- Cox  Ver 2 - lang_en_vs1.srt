1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
I'm James C. Cox.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,595
I'm the Noah Langdale Jr.

3
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:10,725
Chair in Economics, the Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar,

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:15,630
and Director of the Experimental Economic Center at Georgia State University.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm an experimental and behavioral economist,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,060
which if you wondered,

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,590
what does an economist have to do with actual delivery of healthcare?

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,560
The words experimental and behavioral are the keys.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,250
Because the centers of my areas of expertise are how

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,625
people respond to incentives and use information in making decisions,

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:50,855
and how one can design mechanisms to help them improve the decisions that they make.

12
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:58,070
In this case, the problem to be addressed is not lack of information.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,393
Physicians are overwhelmed with information and the problem we face is how to use it.

14
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:09,935
Where my team at the Experimental Economic Center comes in is

15
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:16,465
to start with a large sample of the identified patient records,

16
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:21,675
do an analysis of that data to try and find

17
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:27,990
the predictors of unsuccessful and successful discharge from the hospital,

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,670
and then build on that a clinical decision support system with user

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:44,040
friendly displays that can aid the physicians in making better decisions.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,545
First of all, the economist did the data analysis and then my I.T.

21
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:59,045
staff design the original CDSS that we used in experiments here at Emory.

22
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:05,520
We ran experiments with both resident physicians and fourth year medical students.

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,020
Initially, they were making decisions about virtual patients being represented

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,325
by computers for trained data of real patients.

25
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:22,170
We later did an experiment where we had patient actors called standardized patients.

26
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,730
There were two sources of information which

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,830
was the CDSS and the behavior of these standardized patients,

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,895
and this is the last step

29
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:43,190
before being ready to go out on the patient wards with an intervention.

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,160
Getting prepared to go take that last step onto

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,580
the patient wards is where we encountered really serious problems.

32
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,885
Because at that point,

33
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:58,995
we needed a version of the CD SS that can

34
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:04,425
interact with electronic health records in real time.

35
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:09,325
When we started to try and take that step,

36
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:14,590
we ran into very severe obstacles because you can

37
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,960
imagine protecting patient information is a central concern,

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,145
and we were asking for two-way communication.

39
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:28,855
At that point, both Cerner Corporation and Emory I.T.

40
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,240
essentially balked.

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:40,285
We were in near despair in not being able to get cooperation from Cerner and Emory I.T.

42
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:43,510
in trying to make the next step in getting out of

43
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,245
the laboratory and onto the patient wards.

44
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:56,800
We had a meeting here at Emory with the new director of Emory IT.

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,225
And he made us aware of

46
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:08,530
the fire standards and he invited Mark Grunstein to come,

47
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,790
who said to us, Well,

48
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,339
you've hit a brick wall,

49
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:17,049
but I know how to get through that brick wall.

50
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,005
And it is using fire compliance which is forthcoming.

51
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:31,125
And he provided to us the information we needed for the path forward and also provided

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:35,460
a path to start to walk down that path through

53
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,825
the projects that his class teams could do for us.

54
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:46,335
We were enthusiastic about learning about that path,

55
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:52,465
and having that opportunity to start walking down that path.

56
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:56,880
One of the project teams working on an initial version of

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,740
the app produced some alternative,

58
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,370
very nice displays of the information,

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,845
and this is critical because for the CDS to have value,

60
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,025
it has to have two properties.

61
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:17,080
One is it makes correct predictions about probability of

62
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,935
re-admission of a patient if you discharge them on any given day.

63
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:28,295
But the other thing it needs to do is to present the information in a user-friendly way.

64
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:33,415
So here's what in principle the problem to be solved.

65
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:38,615
The underlying model looks at each patient as though

66
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:44,280
as an individual patient that comes from a population of a very large sample,

67
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,255
for which we know the outcomes of previous decisions,

68
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:52,535
where a patient that looks like your individual patient today,

69
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:56,910
out of a very large sample of 30 or 40 thousand patients.

70
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,815
If you discharge your patients today,

71
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,370
do they look statistically more like

72
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,775
ones who it was unsuccessful and they were re-admitted,

73
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:09,095
or it was successful and they were not?

74
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:13,785
The critical thing then is not only to have the underlying correct predictions,

75
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:21,060
but to display them in a way that the physicians will actually find it easy to use.

76
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,110
And one of the class teams produce

77
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,357
these beautiful information displays and there are two of them.

78
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:33,345
One of them presents the information and is like rectangular block format,

79
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:36,190
another in a beautiful circular format.

80
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,510
But the nature of the information displayed is in

81
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,415
the lower left hand corner of the display,

82
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:49,965
is something that shows the probabilities of re-admission for patients,

83
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:53,425
and it'll show the time sequence

84
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:58,535
from the first day your patient was in the hospital up to the current day.

85
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:03,263
It displays the point estimate of the probability of re-admission,

86
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:06,710
unplanned readmission if you discharge them today,

87
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,285
and the 80% error bounds.

88
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,645
The center of the display

89
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:19,091
shows all of the variables in the patient's record including labs,

90
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:22,355
vitals, all the information,

91
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,470
and those displays are color coded.

92
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,785
And the color coding represents

93
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:32,010
the marginal significance on

94
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,570
probability of re-admission of each of those individual variables.

95
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,860
The user, then, can click on any one of those variable names in

96
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:51,155
the central display and that will open up on the right side of the screen.

97
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:55,760
The detailed information on that individual variable for

98
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,704
your patient including how it varied from the day admission up to the current day,

99
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:06,110
and how that time path of those readings compares

100
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,000
to the normal range of that particular variable.
