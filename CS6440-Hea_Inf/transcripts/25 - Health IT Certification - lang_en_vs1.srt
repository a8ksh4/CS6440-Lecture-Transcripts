00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
The Office of the National Coordinator for health information technology,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,095
or ONC, administers the HIT certification program.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,745
It is voluntary, and includes capabilities such as recording,

4
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:19,185
security, and interoperable sharing of health information.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:24,585
As shown here, the program defines the technical requirements for health IT,

6
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:29,900
and the process by which commercial systems may become and remain certified.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,970
Commercial authorized testing labs do the testing

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,620
using ONC provided criteria and test data sets.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,445
Since hospitals and providers must acquire a certified EHR to receive incentive payments,

10
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:50,085
it's virtually a business necessity for EHR vendors to be certified.

11
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:56,010
ONC reports on its progress on it's HIT dashboard site.

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,980
This graphic from that site shows that as of July 2016,

13
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,420
632 vendors supplied certified health I.T.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,390
to 337432 ambulatory primary care and specialist

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,835
physicians and other providers participating in the Medicare EHR incentive program.

16
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:25,045
While EPIK systems supply certified technology to 30 percent of all those providers,

17
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:28,005
there are 632 vendors in total,

18
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:32,720
something that clearly exacerbates the interoperability challenge.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,940
Here you see that as of July 2016 175 certified vendors supplied systems

20
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,455
to 4474 nonfederal acute care hospitals

21
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:47,865
participating in the Medicare EHR incentive program.

22
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:50,865
This market is far more concentrated,

23
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:55,340
as only ten vendors supplied about 98 percent of hospitals.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,555
But interoperability is still an issue among hospitals.

25
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:02,170
The reasons are not limited to technology:

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,040
too many hospitals and health systems seek to control access to

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,820
their digital records to make it convenient and hence more

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,485
likely that patients will obtain all their care from one source.

29
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:18,820
Importantly the top three vendors listed here have all announced support for

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,850
fire and smart on fire as an EHR connected platform for fire apps,

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,875
including those written by third parties.

32
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:34,295
This liberation of EHR data for innovative purposes may not be classic interoperability,

33
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,890
but it could lead to progress in solving some of

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,000
the EHR challenges we'll discuss later on in this lesson.
