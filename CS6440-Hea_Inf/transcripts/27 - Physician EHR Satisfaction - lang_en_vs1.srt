1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,985
Physician satisfaction with the EHR is an extremely important topic,

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:09,420
and one that will have widespread ramifications

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,060
for the effort to use Health Informatics as

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,440
a tool for establishing

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,705
a learning health care system and effectively using the new knowledge it creates.

6
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:25,740
In 2013, The Rand Corporation and the American Medical Association published what I

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,880
believe to be the best study today on

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,690
overall physician satisfaction including satisfaction with the EHRs.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,365
The survey team selected 30 physician practices to achieve a good cross-section.

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,720
Each practice completed a structured questionnaire that included

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,025
questions about its electronic health record use and capabilities,

12
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:50,505
and participation in innovative payment models.

13
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:53,700
The survey team then visited these practice and conducted

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,315
semi structured interviews with 220 informants.

15
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:05,040
Finally, they surveyed 656 physicians in the 30 practices receiving 447 responses,

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,160
a 68 percent response rate.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,540
Here are the results with respect to satisfaction with the practices EHR.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,340
The majority of physicians believe the EHR

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,600
improves care quality but using it is inefficient of their time.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,460
Interestingly, only 18 percent of

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,335
the physicians indicated they would revert to paper records if they could.

22
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:34,800
Disturbingly, according to the American Academy of Family Practice,

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,360
the AAFP, a strong advocate of the EHRs,

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,050
physician satisfaction with them is declining.

25
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,365
As our baseline in the AAFP 2010 survey,

26
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:55,610
61 percent of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the EHRs.

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:02,300
American EHR partners is a new effort supported by 20 professional societies including

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,140
the AAFP and the American College of Physicians

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,860
another large physician group that advocates for EHRs.

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,280
American EHR has been collecting data since the AAFP survey in 2010,

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,660
and it claims theirs is the only EHR survey that

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,990
charts satisfaction over time and allows for the benchmarking of data.

33
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:34,155
Today, American EHR says it has collected over 7500 responses using the same core survey.

34
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:38,405
They say this allows them to have comprehensive breakdowns by specialty,

35
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,870
practice size, EHR type and so on.

36
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:49,330
The American EHR partners 2014 online survey of 940 physicians found that

37
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,770
42 percent thought their EHR systems ability

38
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,590
to improve efficiency was difficult or very difficult.

39
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,180
72 percent thought their EHR system's ability

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,770
to decrease workload was difficult or very difficult.

41
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,470
54 percent found their EHR system increased their total operating costs,

42
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,190
and 43 percent said they had yet to overcome

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,655
the productivity challenges related to their EHR system.

44
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:24,930
However, over 36,000 physicians received invitations.

45
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,765
So the response rate was only two point six percent.

46
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:30,770
It is certainly possible that

47
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,900
dissatisfied physicians were more motivated to express those feelings,

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,210
a phenomenon known as response bias.

49
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,750
I asked the American EHR about this and they say that

50
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,750
the 2014 results are actually

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,660
consistent with results they've been continuing to receive since then.

52
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,800
In any case, it seems clear that physicians

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,715
find the use of an EHR inefficient and challenging.

54
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:59,160
We next turn to why this is the case.
