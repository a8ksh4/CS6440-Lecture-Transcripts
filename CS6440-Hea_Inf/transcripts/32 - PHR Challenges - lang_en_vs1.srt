1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
Despite technical progress, adoption of

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:06,710
PHRs and other tools for patients remains an issue.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,200
A recent paper suggests that current adoption is around 20% to 30% of

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,250
patients but forecasts say the majority of patients will use a PHR by 2020.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,870
There are several challenges to adoption: getting the data to patients,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,575
privacy concerns, patient engagement, and usability.

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,910
We will cover each of these at a high level.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,310
For more, I refer you to a recent paper that discusses PHRs

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,435
and their challenges in some detail.

10
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:42,180
Once again, interoperability is a key issue.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,125
Absent it, how does PHR data get into a patient's personal record?

12
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,500
This becomes even more problematic if they receive care from

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,140
several providers that we have learned patients with

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,760
multiple chronic diseases typically do.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,480
The most common form of personal health record is a browser-based patient portal.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,500
Enterprise software vendors often supply portals and automatically

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,810
populate them with data from their EHR and their other clinical systems.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,030
Here is an example of a modern patient portal provided by

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,340
Marshfield Clinic Information Services (MCIS).

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,503
This company is a spin-out from the Marshfield Clinic,

21
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,780
one of the most highly regarded health systems in

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,010
the US and an advanced user of informatics.

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,960
Note that it brings together a patient's health record,

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,785
reminders of needed tests and procedures,

25
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:41,900
messaging, and even financial and administrative services.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,430
One of the key goals of meaningful use is to ensure that patients have

27
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,780
electronic access to their records no matter where they receive their care.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,030
In fact, meaningful use has a term for this: view,

29
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,915
download, and transmit or VDT.

30
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,650
And it's a key measure for providers.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,050
In Stage Two, more than 50% of all unique patients seen during

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:12,650
each 90-day reporting period must have had timely access to the health information.

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,300
More than 5% must have actually used this capability.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,580
The second measure seems designed to incent providers to

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,350
explain their VDT tool and encourage their patients to use it.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,820
Some research suggests that this provider engagement is effective.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,340
There are also meaningful use measures related to

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,755
sharing of health data at transitions of care.

39
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:43,155
Continuity of care document or CCD is an HL7-specified,

40
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:49,380
XML-formatted electronic patient summary and is one way to meet this requirement.

41
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,239
As you will see in the health fault exercise that follows,

42
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,625
it's also a way for a patient to easily load

43
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:01,200
all their EHR data from all their providers into a PHR.

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,920
The second challenge is patient concerns about

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,895
the loss of privacy if their health data is stored in the cloud.

46
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:15,425
In a 2008 Markle Foundation survey of 1,580 adults,

47
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:23,040
77% reported privacy concerns related to misuse of personal data by marketeers,

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,470
56% expressed concerns about misuse by employers,

49
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,190
and 53% had similar concerns about health insurers.

50
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,610
The Affordable Care Act provision outlawing the use of preexisting conditions to deny

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,010
health insurance may have alleviated

52
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,185
these concerns to some degree with respect to health insurers.

53
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:47,700
However, with data breaches increasingly common,

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,545
including in health care,

55
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:53,550
this issue is likely to remain a serious challenge.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,860
Finally, there is the challenge of getting patients to use these tools.

57
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,935
Several studies have asked patients what functions they most want from a PHR.

58
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,690
Unsurprisingly, these include access to

59
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,440
their past medical history including immunizations, lab tests,

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,385
and medications, as well as access to their appointments,

61
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,320
and communication with their providers.

62
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,635
Patients often want to access their family member's records.

63
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:24,685
Age, lack of computer literacy,

64
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:30,865
and unfamiliarity with medical terminology are often impediments to PHR use.

65
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:34,180
You'll have an opportunity to explore these challenges and

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,000
usability in particular in the exercise that follows.
