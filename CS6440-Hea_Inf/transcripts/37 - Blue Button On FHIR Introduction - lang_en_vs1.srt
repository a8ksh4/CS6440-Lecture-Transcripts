1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
We discussed patient portals as a way to automate giving patients

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,650
their data that may be limited to data from a single health system.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,290
We then looked at how a PHR or a fire app can make

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,030
this task more manageable across providers.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,390
Could it be even easier for a patient to see

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,970
all their data no matter where they receive care?

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,330
Since they pay for most of it,

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,595
each provider's health insurance company,

9
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:29,355
should have a comprehensive view of their care.

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,805
No matter where it takes place.

11
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,815
This claims data has limitations.

12
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:38,850
For example, while claims would show when a lab test was performed,

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,715
they would not have the result.

14
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,520
However, it may often be

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,720
the most comprehensive longitudinal view of

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,795
a patient's care that is practically available.

17
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,140
Medicare's recognize that and his blue button on

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,415
fire initiative is an innovative approach to patient empowerment.

19
00:00:56,415 --> 00:01:00,875
Paul LeBrone, my colleague and entrepreneur and residence at the CDC,

20
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,075
will now talk with Mark Scrimshaw,

21
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:08,640
Entrepreneur and residence at CMS to learn more about blue button on fire.
