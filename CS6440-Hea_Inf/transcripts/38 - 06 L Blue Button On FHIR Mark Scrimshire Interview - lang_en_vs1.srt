00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
Hi? I'm Matt Scrimshire,

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:08,290
I'm a CMS Blue Button Innovator or entrepreneur-in-residence at CMS.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,850
Mark, what's an entrepreneur-in-residence?

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,690
And how did you end up in this role?

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,705
Interesting you should ask that.

6
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:17,780
I describe it as being paid by the federal government

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,270
to cause trouble inside the federal government.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,640
You know, I think an entrepreneur is someone with a passion

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,600
or naivety to think they can change something for the better.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,930
And so, I've always been passionate about Blue Button and so,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,600
I got invited to go in and a tweet

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,165
said you should apply for this position and I ended up there.

13
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:37,960
So, that's how it goes.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,050
Power of the little birdie.

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,630
Absolutely.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,570
Mark, can you explain the Blue Button on FHIR project,

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,775
and how you came up with the idea.

18
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,630
Blue Button on FHIR.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,745
Blue Button's been around for nearly seven years and,

20
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:54,855
but it's basically a text file that a beneficiary or

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,860
consumer can download from the portal that they use.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,480
The problem is that every Blue Button falls

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,525
different which is a real pain for us as developers.

24
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,919
The idea was it didn't really come from me,

25
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:13,099
but from CMS saying they wanted to upgrade that to become basically a data API.

26
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:15,655
So basically data is a service,

27
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:20,795
and I was brought in to actually tackle that project.

28
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:28,762
The reason it became Blue Button on FHIR is just really a combination of circumstances.

29
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:30,580
I often describe myself as lazy,

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,305
so I didn't want to go and create my own API if there was one out there in the industry.

31
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,410
The advantage of using an industry API is as

32
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,060
the API matures and the tools around it mature, everybody wins.

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,940
The idea was really to build Blue Button,

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,780
the Blue Button text file that CMS distributes to

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,795
beneficiaries as a data API in

36
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:57,440
structured data format that something the industry is going to be able to recognize.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Mark, can you tell us about the size and scope of the Medicare population and

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,255
the claims data set that will be made available through Blue Button on FHIR.

39
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:10,405
Sure. We're making the Blue Button API at CMS available to

40
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,995
all Medicare beneficiaries and

41
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:17,210
that's actually a population of somewhere around 38 million,

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,920
on medicare.gov itself is around I

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,530
think 29 million beneficiaries that actually have accounts.

44
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,685
In terms of the data,

45
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:30,220
we're releasing a part A,

46
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,185
part B, and part D data.

47
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:37,210
That's the hospital, the professional, and pharmacy data.

48
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,430
That's in the current Blue Button file

49
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,180
and they currently receive three years worth of data.

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,130
If you run that up,

51
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,470
it's somewhere between six and eight billion records

52
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,825
that we're going to be making available.

53
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:53,845
In your perspective, what are the advantages and disadvantage of

54
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:58,630
claims data as a source for patient facing apps?

55
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,310
I think the fact that it is just claims data.

56
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,020
The VA and CMS both published Blue Button.

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,140
The VA actually has a lot of clinical data in their information set and

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,235
that shows that the veterans come back to download that data more frequently.

59
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:22,350
For us, we really just have the part A,

60
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,940
part B and part D claims data.

61
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,595
It is claims data, but it's also something that

62
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:32,650
patients will actually recognize because they usually see the bill.

63
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,070
There were a bunch of these,

64
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:41,120
what we're looking at is because we're building with the FHIR API that the API can be

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,459
extended to cover other data sets or other resources within the FHIR specification,

66
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,850
so the Blue Button API could be used for example in a hospital situation or

67
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,635
maybe for the Veterans Administration and be able to release those other types of data,

68
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,470
but using the same basic Handshakes that we are trying to pioneer here at CMS.

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,865
After the patient has given authorization?

70
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:04,450
Exactly.

71
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,717
With blueprint on FHIR,

72
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:10,280
how do you handle access to the appropriate data?

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,835
There's a number of aspects to that question.

74
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:20,810
Firstly, the Blue Button API will connect a beneficiary to their data.

75
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,670
We'll be matching them.

76
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,650
That's one slight change to

77
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,060
the FHIR specification is that we will be sort of overriding and saying,

78
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,995
"No Paula, you can only get your data."

79
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:34,070
So, we're limiting what they can release.

80
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,470
It's an important thing to understand some developers

81
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,855
think that by connecting to the Blue Button API,

82
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,840
they can get at those 38 million patients' records.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,205
No, you have to recruit each patient and get them to authorize your access,

84
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,115
so there's that aspect to it.

85
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,720
Then there's the question of well,

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,095
how do we choose about trusting applications?

87
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:02,705
Well, that's a really good question and that is fairly complex because on the one side,

88
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,600
you've got CMS or any other data holder in

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,785
this industry takes really seriously the security of their data.

90
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,750
At the other end of the spectrum,

91
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,280
you've got the directive from the Office of Civil Rights and you've got enshrined HIPAA.

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,900
The fact that a patient has an absolute right to their data.

93
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,105
Additionally, a lot of people say, well,

94
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:28,150
what about data being sent off to a hacker in Russia?

95
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,155
Well, actually the fact is,

96
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:37,330
that a patient can knowingly choose to send their data to a hacker in Russia if they,

97
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,590
if they want to, that they are perfectly at liberty to do that.

98
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,955
The question is we want to try and take steps so that they don't unknowingly do that.

99
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:52,960
One of the things that we've certainly been pushing with CMS here is

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,350
saying every data holder in this industry has the same problem.

101
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,660
Every developer aiming to do work in this industry has

102
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,985
the same problem of having permission to connect to the API.

103
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:10,135
Well, with Blue Button on FHIR as an API,

104
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,205
you as a developer can connect and get a key,

105
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:18,700
but you have zero access to any data until a beneficiary gives you access.

106
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,100
What we're trying to stimulate a discussion

107
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,895
around is really the establishment of let's call them

108
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:31,692
trust communities or endorsers that could endorse third-party applications,

109
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:37,492
and those applications could bring some sort of token to a data holder like CMS and say,

110
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,210
"Hey, we've been checked out over there."

111
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,330
And in that way what it does is it then starts to

112
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,680
create a scenario where the patient could

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,065
see a badge that says this application has been validated by this organization,

114
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,530
or maybe knows somebody who created

115
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,875
an application over the weekend and they want to share it with their family.

116
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes they should be able to do that,

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,650
but if they do that and we see that they did

118
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,665
that application doesn't have some sort of validation token,

119
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,505
we can at least ask the patient, the consumer,

120
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:16,550
if they want to do something stupid and share their data with that application.

121
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,985
It's a complex scenario and I think we have to have a range of

122
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:27,450
solutions that tie together to reduce the risk for the data holder,

123
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,480
make it easier for the developer to integrate

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,555
with lots and lots of different data access points,

125
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:37,660
and the patient to have a clue about what they share and who they're sharing with.

126
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,010
What benefits does CMS hope to achieve by

127
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,510
allowing patients to access their own data through Blue Button on FHIR?

128
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:51,795
Well, I think we see that really we're entering an era of more retail medicine.

129
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:56,355
The patient, the consumer is going to take more control over their health.

130
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,590
Well, how do they do that without data?

131
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,390
The Blue Button on FHIR API is really trying to

132
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,680
open up the gates so that consumers can get access

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,800
to their data and find partners they

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,863
trust to help them look at that data because they do not want the data for its own sake,

135
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,290
they want to do something with it.

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,640
They want whether it's to donate it to research,

137
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,800
to put into a personal health record app or some concierge app or

138
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,665
their doctor's EMR because they trust their doctor.

139
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,860
It's going to be their choice.

140
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,340
And we want to simply make the data flow so much like Todd Park said,

141
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,410
it's really about like creating the,

142
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,420
being the knower of` health care,

143
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,545
allowing the data to flow and lets

144
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:46,610
an ecosystem of applications spring up service particular needs.

145
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,915
And network effects will start to kick in.

146
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,440
Absolutely. When I was

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,955
first starting out on this role somebody actually reached out to me and said,

148
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:59,173
"so, are you going to be building a diabetes app?"

149
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,628
And I said, "No, we're, we're building a pipeline."

150
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,500
And if you were an expert on diabetes,

151
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,190
go and build that app.

152
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,905
What are your hopes and future plans for Blue Button on FHIR?

153
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:16,570
We're actually building the Blue Button on FHIR API as a two part API.

154
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,130
We're building on the reference platforms that are already emerging in the industry,

155
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,590
and we built a front-end.

156
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,570
It's all open source,

157
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,850
so we would love other institutions and organizations to take our front-end and plug it

158
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,694
into FHIR modules that are coming out of all of the big EMR vendors.

159
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,470
There's that opportunity to create

160
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,420
a more consistent API for a growing ecosystem of applications to connect into.

161
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,505
I think the other side of it is dealing with this issue of trust for applications,

162
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,930
we have to solve this problem for the data holders,

163
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,420
the developers, and the patient.

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,910
And so, I'm looking to see that,

165
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,415
to try and stimulate that work,

166
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:05,985
and to that end there's a few of us that have been working on this opensource front-end.

167
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,145
You can go to GitHub,

168
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,810
look at Transparent Health,

169
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,460
find HHS OAuth server and you'll find our code.

170
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,120
What we're doing is we're evolving that into a not for

171
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,815
profit foundation so that we can have both the commercial and noncommercial entity,

172
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:29,850
because any organizations looking to seriously append

173
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,810
on an API like this is going to as they say in the industry,

174
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,400
one to throat to choke.

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,870
They may want to license some sort of service or support from an organization,

176
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,100
and I think that's a good thing because that would potentially

177
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,860
create longevity around the API,

178
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,515
and see it as it lives on and continues to get developed.

179
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:54,705
We'd love to see it get adopted not only in this country,

180
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,630
but internationally, which is certainly within

181
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,060
the realms of possibility because FHIR is an international standard.

182
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,950
Thank you so much for your time.

183
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,610
It's a pleasure.
