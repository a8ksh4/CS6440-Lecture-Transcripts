1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,475
First, Mark, it's a pleasure to be here today.

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:06,201
I'd like to introduce my colleague, Cheryl Hiddleston,

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:10,315
who will tell you a little bit about what she does.

4
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:11,677
Hi. I'm Cheryl Hiddleston,

5
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,510
I have been a nurse for 33 years.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,710
For 26 of those,

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,185
I've been in critical care,

8
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:20,191
and I currently run the Emory eICU program.

9
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,285
And my name is Tim Buckman.

10
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:26,795
I have the privilege being the founding director of Emory's Critical Care Center.

11
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:30,325
I'm the Medical Director of Emory's eICU program.

12
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:36,110
Perhaps, we ought to tell you a little bit about what an ICU is and what an eICU is.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,793
That would be great.

14
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:41,680
You know, we all enjoy our health but at some point,

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,500
we all will face serious health problems.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,880
And when our vital organs, heart, lungs, liver,

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,525
kidneys become compromised they can fail to the point where our lives are threatened.

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,059
That's where the ICU comes in.

19
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,475
Patients are admitted to intensive care units,

20
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,615
in order to stabilize their vital functions,

21
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:07,705
set the stage for healing and allow them to improve.

22
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:13,880
Now traditionally that's been all at the bedside, critical care nurses,

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,940
critical care physicians,

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,500
other allied health professionals working to stabilize the patient at the elbow.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,240
But in the era of long distance telecommunication,

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,596
a new option has evolved. Cheryl, tell them about eICU.

27
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:33,218
The eICU is a program that provides

28
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,980
remote surveillance monitoring of patients in the ICUs at different hospitals.

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,440
We have cameras, monitors, and mics,

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,250
and speakers in each patient room that allows our team,

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,440
which is located remotely in

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,155
basically an office building to have bidirectional communication with the staff,

33
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,710
the family, and the patient who are in the ICUs.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,960
With the monitoring that we do,

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,540
the system pulls different data from

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,240
the bedside monitor and

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,010
the electronic medical record and has different algorithms built in it,

38
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,953
and it allows us to catch when

39
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:16,725
patients are veering off trajectory into the wrong direction.

40
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:21,595
So we can call the staff at the bedside and help intervene.

41
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,145
Now it's a lot of data.

42
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:26,260
We have the same big data problem, the four Vs, the velocity, variety, veracity,

43
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,790
value that everyone has in the big data space.

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,372
The difference is we have to find problems and fix them right now.

45
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:44,115
Because if we don't deliver the right care right now for every patient every time,

46
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,480
the patient is going to suffer.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,830
Let's talk about an example,

48
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,270
that is a prominent one in critical care.

49
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,663
We all have kidneys.

50
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:58,300
They allow us to not only get rid of excess water

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,300
but excess toxins and without good kidney function,

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,340
those toxins build up,

53
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,730
the various balance of electrolytes and fluids in the body goes awry.

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,320
And with total kidney failure, people can die.

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,540
So we have to find that problem and fix it right away.

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,225
One of the conventional measures

57
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:24,130
of kidney function is actually taken from the bloodstream,

58
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,137
a chemical called creatinine.

59
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:29,887
Creatinine is produced as a product of

60
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:34,745
normal metabolism by muscles and then excreted by the kidneys.

61
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:38,730
When the kidneys fail to function well, creatinine builds up.

62
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,887
And when the kidneys resume their function,

63
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,345
creatinine decreases in concentration in the bloodstream.

64
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:50,100
Now there are two or three problems.

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,010
The first is that creatinine isn't sampled continuously,

66
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,880
it isn't even sampled regularly, it's sampled irregularly.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,170
So physicians at best have

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,650
an irregular time series from which to

69
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,850
try to reason whether the kidney function is getting better,

70
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,970
getting worse, or staying the same.

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,817
And if you look at the visualization on the left is conventional picture of creatinine,

72
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:21,545
a plot of creatinine measurements versus time.

73
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:25,010
And what you'll see is that creatinine rises when

74
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,815
kidneys fail in this sense when kidneys recover function.

75
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:36,820
But we needed a way to look more deeply into the data to discover whether there might be

76
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,810
hidden information in the time series that would allow us to

77
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,685
recognize even earlier first the kidney function is getting worse,

78
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,395
and even more importantly,

79
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,702
the kidney function is recovering.

80
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:51,276
Why do we want to know the kidney function is recovered?

81
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:54,105
We want to be able to

82
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,950
tell patients and families that things are getting better as soon as possible.

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:04,580
So we charged a team in the course with helping us develop a novel visualization.

84
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,035
That's shown on the right.

85
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,760
It's a phase diagram,

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,235
plotting the change in creatinine over time on the Y-axis

87
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:18,110
versus the concentration of creatinine on the X-axis.

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,064
And what you can see even as creatinine is rising,

89
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:28,125
there's an inflection point where the rate of change of that rise is falling.

90
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,330
That's our earliest signal that kidney function is

91
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,065
actually improving and being able to see these displays,

92
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:42,490
these phase diagrams allows us to recognize the problem earlier,

93
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,445
and even more importantly to recognize recovery earlier.

94
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:49,040
That matters to caregivers but it also

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,900
matters more to the patients for whom we deliver care.

96
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:00,590
I'll let Cheryl speak a bit about

97
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,430
the challenges we face even in

98
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:11,665
the standard clinical realm of bringing health care messages into our care environment.

99
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:17,815
As Tim said, normally for laboratory values,

100
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,630
they're checked intermittently, there's

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,210
no regular schedule that they're checked on necessarily.

102
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,425
It's done per a physician's orders and what they determine needs to be done.

103
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:38,640
So we have a database for all of the patients we provide care for and in order to

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,200
get more real-time access to that information and

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,975
have the data pushed out to us rather than having to wait for it to come in the system,

106
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,685
having someone look at it.

107
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,155
That's what we discussed with the students.

108
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:56,490
Now trying to get access to that database for

109
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,920
them was kind of a hurdle because it's patient information that's involved.

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,660
So we had to get compliance involved,

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,670
we had to get the IS resources involved to

112
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,260
make sure that the Georgia Tech students had access to the data,

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,725
so they could build the application.

114
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,815
So we could actually develop the tools.

115
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,475
Now what's interesting of course is that there are

116
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:25,482
international standards around healthcare messaging, so-called HL7 standard.

117
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:32,130
And we use that standard in our communications with the hospitals we serve.

118
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,900
The problem is that HL7 messaging has evolved

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,794
and Version 1 was primitive and Version 2 was manageable, Version 3, well,

120
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:47,645
it became seriously bloated,

121
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:55,490
often 60 pages of data just to report the single laboratory value.

122
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,350
And quite candidly, that's more than

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,443
current systems are able to manage efficiently and effectively in real-time.

124
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:06,210
Fortunately, the communities who

125
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,745
develop these standards recognized that they'd created a problem and said,

126
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,510
we have to do it faster.

127
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:19,650
We actually have to get Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources up and running.

128
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,580
FHIR, that's what FHIR is all about.

129
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,615
And what our students have done,

130
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:28,350
they've helped us to take

131
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,310
our existing databases into which all the data are falling and said,

132
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,960
we can simplify not the incoming messages

133
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,245
because those are fixed by standards but outgoing messages.

134
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:47,517
We can help clinicians access those data faster and better by FHIR enabling the database.

135
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:55,164
And that really is a major event because data that's not available in

136
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:58,200
the moment is data that is

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,197
the delayed and decisions that are delayed and ultimately the care is delayed.

138
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:12,980
We recognize that every human being

139
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,347
is different but they get sick in a fairly patterned fashion.

140
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:21,900
So our job is to recognize the patterns.

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,360
You would think this would be easy but recognize that every human being has

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,900
12 different body systems add the dimension of

143
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,430
time and we have a 13-dimensional problem with sparse data.

144
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,190
So picking up the patterns is tough.

145
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,780
We have a couple of things we can do though.

146
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,504
We can have machines recognize and pick out the patterns and our responses.

147
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:49,750
In fact, that's going to be much of the future of medicine,

148
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:57,040
to follow patterns and provide the responses that seem to be most common.

149
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,738
It's especially helpful in our environment because our patients are so complex

150
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:08,715
and threading down to the abstraction that matters,

151
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,120
the getting sick and what we can do to help

152
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,545
people get well is an important part of what we do.

153
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:18,925
What's going to happen in the future?

154
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,225
We think that there're couple of steps.

155
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,580
The first is a form of crowdsourcing.

156
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,490
We will ask our clinicians and ask the machines behind our clinicians to

157
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,115
keep track of what data patterns are clinically meaningful and which are not.

158
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:42,955
Second, we'll go into the data and begin to cull out the universal responses.

159
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:46,290
We'll find two or three responses to every problem.

160
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,915
But what we can do further and we can use the data

161
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,393
going forward to determine which of

162
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:56,390
the responses to the problem, actually leads to the better outcome.

163
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,150
This is emerging of knowledge based care.

164
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,815
Things have come from evidence-based medicine and code, things that have come,

165
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:10,495
this is emerging of knowledge based care,

166
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:15,123
things that have come from evidence data.

167
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:19,865
This is emerging of knowledge based care,

168
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:24,981
knowledge that's encoded in algorithms and decision trees with database care,

169
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:27,920
recognizing the 1,000 or 10,000,

170
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,325
or 100,000 nearest neighbors and

171
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,290
understanding what care has been provided and understanding the outcomes of those cared.

172
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,815
The eICU is a perfect training ground

173
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:43,700
for this because instead of asking clinicians at the bedside,

174
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,610
who are very busy taking care of patients,

175
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,925
"Oh, is this appropriate?"

176
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:50,440
"Is this an actionable item?"

177
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,525
It pulls them away from patient care.

178
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,025
So in the eICU, you have nurses,

179
00:11:55,025 --> 00:12:01,790
who are trained in detecting when there's an anomaly and there's something different.

180
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,630
So it's a perfect area to try and build this sort of knowledge.

181
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,825
If we can improve our detection of anomalies,

182
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:13,134
improve our understanding of the options available to us,

183
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:17,380
and improve our understanding of the outcomes of those options.

184
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,550
We're going to get better outcomes for all of our patients.
