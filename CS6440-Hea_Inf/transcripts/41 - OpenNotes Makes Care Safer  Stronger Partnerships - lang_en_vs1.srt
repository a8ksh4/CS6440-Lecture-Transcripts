1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,475
>>When you think about the diagnostic error or anchoring around a diagnosis,

2
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,194
having the patients read their note and actually see that

3
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:15,615
the physician clearly hear and understand the symptoms I was describing,

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,986
it has the opportunity to break a diagnostic anchoring.

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,225
>> One physician referred to me as having type 2 diabetes.

6
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,970
And someone had mentioned that a surgery that I

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,105
had was on the right side but it was on the left side.

8
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:32,900
So I've been able to go in and just let

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,060
the physicians know that you've made a mistake and they've corrected it.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,390
>>It's not just patient engagement,

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,330
it's really about patient empowerment in care.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,270
So we are basically inviting the patient,

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,895
we're nudging them and really asking them to go in and use this

14
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,790
and not just read it in a sort of passive way but give

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,875
us feedback on it and tell us what we could do,

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,090
what we did wrong, and tell us what we could do to make it better.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,280
That's huge. We have not done very much of that in medicine.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,163
We've just told the patient what to do.

19
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:09,953
>>I think one of the benefits for everybody moving away from

20
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,740
doctor knows best to doctor and

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,650
patient working together is that it's going to be recognized.

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,955
So the team owns the outcome.

23
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:21,740
>>I guess I am somebody who believes that trust will

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,845
be easier to come by between doctor and patient if there's more candor and openness.

25
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:31,220
Doctors and patients and family members who know that

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,940
there's a level of transparency will shift their behavior.

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,065
>>The thing that I care about the most with our department is what we call culture,

28
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,705
and culture is built in small acts.

29
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:46,340
Every little small thing you do that makes the environment more respectful,

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,580
more inclusive of patients creates that culture.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,030
This is probably not a small, thing this is a big thing.

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,895
But for me, that's what this is,

33
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:56,990
this is another aspect of a way to be respectful,

34
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,020
inclusive and partner in patients for the ultimate goal

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,510
of improving their care and their satisfaction with our care.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,480
So that's why I love openness.
