00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
You now know that chronic diseases drive most U.S. health care costs.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,970
Once diagnosed, they're usually not curable.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,130
What patients do in terms of behavior and compliance with

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,440
their treatments is critical to success in managing them.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,350
As a result, there has long been interest in the potential of technology in

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,545
the home to create a more continuous and coordinated approach to care of these patients.

7
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:29,655
This is yet another old health informatics idea,

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,070
only now coming to fruition.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,075
Here's a photo of Steve Kaufmann,

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,570
one of the early innovators in this space,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,440
with Hank, his home assisted nursing care robot.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,660
Hank offered a wide variety of voice control nursing services

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,935
to patients at home in the mid 1990's.

14
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,680
Among other things, Hank dispensed medications at

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,430
the proper time and took physiologic measurements,

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,940
such as blood pressure with its patient-operated devices,

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,425
using the technology of the day.

18
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,165
During the same period,

19
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:06,125
I was one of the founders of a company that provided

20
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,450
an electronic records system for

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,275
the home care nurses who took care of patients after they left the hospital.

22
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:16,280
We could see the benefit of knowing more about the patients between

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,935
nursing visits and reinforcing the instructions the nurses provided.

24
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:26,040
We developed this roughly cigar-box-sized touchscreen device that,

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,090
like Hank, spoke to the patients.

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,775
It, too, had integrated physiologic measurement devices.

27
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,145
Of course, as you'd expect,

28
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:39,165
software for home care is now available on smartphones.

29
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,425
This example is from AlayaCare, a Canadian company.

30
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:47,775
It provides nurses with a patient overview at a glance on their phone,

31
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,025
along with important documentation,

32
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,610
administrative, and billing functions.

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,145
Patients record some of the data as is illustrated here.

34
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:00,110
This example question would be part of something similar to

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,255
a Likert survey that collects the patient's point of view on a daily basis.

36
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:08,985
Along with vital signs data coming from the peripherals,

37
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,765
it informs an algorithm we'll discuss later.

38
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:15,230
Of course, it is no longer necessary to provide

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,560
integrated physiologic devices since they are

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,205
consumer-level products and most have wireless Bluetooth syncing capability.

41
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:28,330
The company says, it can sync data from over 200 devices.

42
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,785
It brings this data together,

43
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:33,615
as shown here, for quick review by the nurse.

44
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:39,085
Finally, this dashboard provides nurses with a quick overview of their patients.

45
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:44,485
It provides a graphical representation of the incoming data from various devices.

46
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:50,685
Importantly, since a value might be normal for one patient but abnormal for another,

47
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:55,365
each measure has patient-specific upper and lower bound thresholds

48
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:58,990
that trigger workflows for various care team members.

49
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,680
If a threshold boundary is detected,

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,320
a risk score is calculated using rules developed by machine learning.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,530
The risk score is a combination of the patients ICD-10 diagnoses,

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,370
demographic information, vital signs data,

53
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,310
and their Likert survey.

54
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,580
AlayaCare train their model using data sets from their remote monitoring partners

55
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,000
that critically include events such as hospital re-admissions or E.R. visits.
