00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
In 2013, Grahame Greive,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,915
the leader of the global HL7's FHIR effort,

3
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:10,830
posted in reference to semantic interoperability quote,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,655
"Let's not pursue the holy grail right now."

5
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,100
End quote. At present,

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,210
FHIR does not attempt to address semantic interoperability in large part because of

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,875
the additional complexity that would introduce to an already complex effort.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,710
I will give you a sense of that complexity here,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,552
but a complete treatment of the subject is well beyond the scope of this course.

10
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:37,430
There are many strongly held points of view

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,210
about the feasibility of semantic interoperability.

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,010
There are also strong advocates for

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,215
various approaches to a semantic interoperability standard.

14
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:50,065
We will now discuss one of the latest approaches.

15
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:54,190
The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative, or CIMI,

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:02,490
is another HL7 working group conceived by the same fresh look task force that birth FHIR.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,330
Its mission is to improve the interoperability of healthcare systems through

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,915
shared implementable clinical information models.

19
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:15,100
The ultimate goal is semantic interoperability.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,130
It is important to understand that data exchange and the use of

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,225
coding systems alone is insufficient to achieve semantic interoperability.

22
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,245
There are many codes for lab test or clinical diagnosis.

23
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,115
In the case of a lab test,

24
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:36,630
codes could specifically indicate which of several available methods the lab used.

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,105
And this could affect the interpretation of the result.

26
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:45,105
Other codes might just indicate what kind of test produce the result.

27
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:51,765
For a diagnosis, there can be many levels of coding detail and specificity.

28
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:55,395
There can also be structural differences in coding systems.

29
00:01:55,395 --> 00:02:00,387
Providers can differ as to how and when they use these codes.

30
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,550
Finally, as we will now discuss,

31
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,670
multiple EHR is going to address the representation

32
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,995
of the same clinical concept differently.

33
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,910
Here's a simple illustration of the variability of

34
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:19,070
representation and of the semantic interoperability problem CIMI is trying to solve.

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:25,480
Three EHR systems represent the concept of suspected lung cancer differently.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,980
In the general practice EHR on the left,

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,430
it is a compound construct created by combining three structured data elements.

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,370
In the hospital EHR on the right,

39
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,130
it's a single concept,

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,195
but polyclinics EHR in the middle combines both approaches.

41
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:47,095
There isn't a right or wrong way to do this,

42
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:51,010
but three different ways in parallel makes it harder to aggregate

43
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,380
the data meaningfully for analysis or to share it to coordinate care.

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,243
among these three practices.

45
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:02,180
Here, this CIMI graphic uses shapes to represent

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,390
the different ways the three EHR systems represent this single clinical concept.

47
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,660
For the purposes of illustration,

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,950
we're assuming the blue hexagon,

49
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,920
the approach used by the general practice EHR,

50
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,830
is the preferred shape,

51
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,920
and a hypothetical translation servers might put

52
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,054
all the instances of this clinical finding into that shape.

53
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:31,210
This is essentially a standard structure in which terms always go in the same place,

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,695
somewhat like in the HL7 messages we discussed earlier.

55
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,260
FHIR resources also provide

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,025
a standard structure specifying where data elements are located.

57
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:48,650
In that context, semantic interoperability specifies what formats and values to

58
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,553
use in specific clinical scenarios often called use cases.

59
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:59,645
As shown here in the most advanced CIMI proposed solution,

60
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,915
data not only goes into a consistent location,

61
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:08,020
but the terms are also translated into an agreed upon standard.

62
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,750
Now, a hypothetical FHIR app gets the same structure and

63
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,129
terms even though the source systems use different representations for both.

64
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,965
As I mentioned earlier,

65
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:21,530
semantic interoperability is difficult to

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,408
achieve given the complexity of health care data,

67
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:31,936
the many ways in which it is represented and the many contexts in which it is used.

68
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:35,150
We will discuss FHIR profiles later,

69
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,715
but they essentially constrain the standard for a particular use case,

70
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:43,330
thus, they can specify the preferred shape.

71
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,730
CIMI anticipates that its models will connect to an informed or

72
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,679
constrained FHIR through model derived profiles.

73
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,510
Next, we look at some exciting capabilities that

74
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,000
might be practical given semantic interoperability.
