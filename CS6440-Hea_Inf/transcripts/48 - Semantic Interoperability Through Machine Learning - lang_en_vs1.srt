00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
Earlier I said there are many points of view on semantic interoperability.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,560
Lloyd McKenzie is an internationally recognized expert

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,910
in HL7 data modeling and design and an adviser to Canada Health Infoway,

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,484
an organization with roughly the same role that the ONC plays here in the US.

5
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:27,704
In March 2013, he posted this on Graeme Greaves blog,

6
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:34,260
"Really robust semantic interoperability is going to be dependent on machine learning and

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,190
other technologies that will allow the computer to be at least as

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,810
good at reasoning and inferring context as humans are now.

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,424
At which point we won't need discrete data at all.

10
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:50,730
Computers will be able to take a big blob of text, dictation,

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,810
images and so on and extract all the relevant information

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,925
needed for their functions without it being neatly divided up for them."

13
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:03,825
I believe this is an important point of view.

14
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:08,840
Later, we will talk more about the potential for machine learning in healthcare.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,805
For now, it is worth noting that the explosion in the use of this technology

16
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:19,985
was in large part due to the availability of huge digital data sets on the internet.

17
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:23,950
After all, the learning part of machine learning comes about when

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,525
computers process a huge number of examples of something.

19
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:31,190
This might be pictures of cats.

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,030
It might be examples of some text translated into another language.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,710
It also might be EHR notes about rheumatoid arthritis.

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,040
Those first two data sets have been widely

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,325
available for some time now because of the Internet.

24
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:52,455
To be fair, they are also quite a bit more consistent than EHR notes.

25
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,160
Finally, of course, there are no privacy laws covering

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,105
cat photos or openly available translations of text.

27
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:05,590
Nevertheless, with EHR adoption now widespread and assuming we can

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,420
solve the easier levels of interoperability and have broader access to clinical data,

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,000
might semantic interoperability be best left to machines to figure out?
