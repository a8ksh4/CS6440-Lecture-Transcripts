1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
The meaningful use criteria promote

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,975
robust interoperability between the systems used by patients,

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,990
providers, and healthcare institutions.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,060
Meaningful use stages progressively demand

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,420
compliance with this patient engagement framework,

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,580
or PEF, developed by

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,760
the HIMSS Foundation and the National eHealth Collaborative that are now merged.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,860
You can see how the stages of meaningful use align with the PEF.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,565
Stage one of meaningful use,

10
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,835
the Engage Me phase of the PEF,

11
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:38,480
specifies that patients can view and download their electronic health record.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,853
Stage two, the Empower Me phase of the PEF,

13
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:44,705
is far more ambitious,

14
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:48,530
and specifies integration with the Health Information Exchange,

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,425
or HIE, our next topic,

16
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:55,415
as well as e-referral coordination among providers,

17
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:58,895
ambulatory and hospital records integration,

18
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:02,338
the addition of images and video to EHRs,

19
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:08,010
and the inclusion of data from commercial labs, radiology, and pharmacies.

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,810
We're currently quite far away from having all of this everywhere,

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,460
but each of these capabilities is available in at least some places.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,800
Presumably because of Meaningful Use,

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,605
a New York study showed the reported rate of PHR use increased from 11 percent,

24
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:29,100
2012 to 17 percent, 2013.

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,220
More directly to the point,

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,680
the proportion of the PHRs provided by doctors or

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,940
healthcare organizations increased sharply from 50 percent,

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,160
2012 to 73 percent in 2013.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,840
This research also showed that the mean age of PHR users was 47.2 years,

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,480
51 percent were female,

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,000
and 80 percent had a physician who used the HRs.
