1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,825
In this lesson, we're going to talk about the U.S. healthcare system.

2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:09,870
This is a complex topic that cannot be adequately covered in a single lecture.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,300
So, I've provided suggested readings.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,870
Some students wonder why I devote an entire lesson to

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,005
the US health care systems structure and economics in what is after all,

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,980
a health informatics course.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,360
Many Georgia Tech students come to

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,800
this course with little background in the health care delivery system.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,310
Health Informatics, the focus of this course is

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,380
the application of information technology to that delivery system.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,090
I believe you need at least a basic grounding to appreciate the nature of

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,610
the system and the key roles Health Informatics can play in solving its problems.

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,670
To give some examples,

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,655
informatics can help avoid medical errors that often arise from inadequate information,

15
00:00:56,655 --> 00:01:01,625
or the presence of more information than a human being can process.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:08,210
It can help identifying reduce waste to unnecessary, or duplicative services.

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,380
It is critical to the surveillance of food borne analysis and disease outbreaks.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,155
Data mining and many analytic techniques

19
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,380
are increasingly being used to find new medicines,

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,925
new treatment protocols, and new methods for earlier diagnosis.

21
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:29,800
These are just a few of the potential informatics benefits to health care delivery.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,575
But each of them depends to one degree or another on the ability to share digital data.

23
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:41,110
As you'll see, now that most hospitals and around half of all providers have adopted

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,250
electronic record systems data sharing and interoperability is now the focus.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,730
So, this course is largely about interoperability and

26
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,800
the role that the new HL seven fire standard plays in creating it.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,520
To get ready for that,

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,425
we'll first discuss the US healthcare system and its problems.

29
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,595
And then, we'll begin the discussion of the role in

30
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:11,270
interoperable informatics landscape can play in solving them.
