00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
Later in this lesson,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,760
we will discuss health information exchange for HIE,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,955
technologies for sharing health data.

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:17,605
First, any transport mechanism for HIE must assure privacy, security, and trust.

5
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:22,200
Privacy means sharing data only with patient permission.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,235
Security means protecting that data from access by unauthorized entities.

7
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:31,850
To create trust an entity must ensure

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,750
the identity of other entities with which they share data.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,755
Here in the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,

10
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:45,595
or HIPA, created a privacy rule.

11
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,715
The government says it quote,

12
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,060
establishes national standards to protect

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,095
individuals' medical records and other personal health information,

14
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,195
and applies to health plans,

15
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,190
health care clearing houses,

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,680
and those health care providers that conduct

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,065
certain health care transactions electronically.

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,455
The inclusion of health insurance plans and claims clearing houses,

19
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:13,645
and the focus on electronic transactions such as claims for payment,

20
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:18,930
may seem surprising to those of us focused on clinical use cases.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,480
But the law also mandates uniform standards for electronic transmission

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,455
of administrative and financial data relating to patient health information.

23
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,050
The intent was to move these transactions from paper to

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,815
electronic form and that has been quite successful.

25
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:40,900
The rule also gives patients rights over their health information,

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,370
including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records,

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,000
and to request corrections.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,980
HIPA penalties can be substantial and may include prison time.

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,050
So staying within the law is a priority in virtually all healthcare organizations.
