1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
We touched on privacy in the healthful exercise.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,170
When you saw how patients could specify the subset of their data they wish to share.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,770
In practice, patients still typically sign a form provided on

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,450
a clipboard in the waiting room and agree to

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,445
share all their medical record data for treatment,

6
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:26,020
payment and health care operations, so-called TPO.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,420
In simple terms, this allows sharing of

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,170
their data with others involved in their treatment,

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,535
such as when their doctor refers them to another physician.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,170
It also allows use of their data in claims for payment for services

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,450
rendered and for operational purposes such as quality reporting.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,920
Beyond the routine use encompassed by TPO,

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,250
there are many secondary purposes for using health data.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,435
These include comparative studies,

15
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:59,190
policy assessments, and life science research.

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,740
These uses of identifiable or so-called protected health information,

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,760
PHI, requires specific permission of the patient.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,920
De-identification removes data from privacy rule protections by

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,980
eliminating 18 specified fields that could identify the individual patient.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,660
Limited data sets still contain dates for admission,

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,360
discharge in service provision,

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,155
date of birth, date of death and city state and zip code.

23
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:39,325
The use of limited data sets for research does not require specific patient permission,

24
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:43,040
but it does require that the data be treated the same as

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,188
PHI since re-identification is possible,

26
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,432
given the inclusion of this temporal and demographic information.

27
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:55,065
To avoid this, in some circumstances,

28
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:57,900
researchers randomly alter dates and

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,930
other data where this will not compromise its research value.

30
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:08,140
Genomic data presents special challenges because each patient's genome is unique.

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,075
So altering the genomic data can severely compromise it's value.

32
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:18,790
There is a second approved but less often used method in which an expert,

33
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,260
who may have a statistical mathematical or scientific background,

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,780
certifies that the risk of re-identification is very small.

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,090
This can also involve some manipulation of

36
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,525
the data so the NORC group at the University of Chicago has developed XID,

37
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,710
a tool shown here that uses

38
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,300
proprietary statistical methods to give data owners the ability

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,000
to experiment digitally and refine their desired risk and analytic utility thresholds.
