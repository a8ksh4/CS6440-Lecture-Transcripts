1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
The use of digital signatures is an example of

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,655
technology to establish trust in the origin of a document.

3
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:12,370
However trust says no purely technologic solution.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,090
Some trusted organisation ultimately must verify that entities involved in

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,235
the exchange of health information are who they claim to be.

6
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:24,630
Hospitals already do this when they credential

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,580
providers to care for patients in their institution.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,070
Establishing trust is harder when patients become involved in adding

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,050
information to their EHR or in retrieving information from it.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,910
Think back to how fault's support a direct email for data sharing.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,620
How might a provider know for sure that

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,895
such an email they receive actually comes from their patient.

13
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:54,070
This problem is harder when patients receive care from multiple organizations,

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,369
each of which must trust that the other has properly validated their identity.

15
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,995
Because we do not have a universal patient ID here in the US,

16
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:07,260
just being sure of the identity of patients can be challenging.
