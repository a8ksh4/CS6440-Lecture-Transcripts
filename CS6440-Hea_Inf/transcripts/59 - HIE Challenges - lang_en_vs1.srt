1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,595
The federal high tech program supported the development of state HIEs.

2
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,810
As a result of that,

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,435
of growing EHR adoption,

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:14,025
and of the data sharing requirements of meaningful use,

5
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,910
2015 addition of a survey sponsored by

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,340
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reported that as of 2014,

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,350
76 percent of hospitals were exchanging data with outside health professionals,

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,765
including ambulatory health professionals and other hospitals.

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:39,135
This was up from 62 percent in 2013 and 41 percent 2008.

10
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,310
The shared data might include laboratory results,

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,500
radiology reports, clinical care summaries, or medications.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,615
Despite this growth HIEs reported many barriers.

13
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:58,820
Only 46 percent of our operational HIEs and 38 percent of HIE efforts

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,940
in the planning stage reported that they were able to

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,645
cover our operating costs with revenue from participants.

16
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,620
This has long been an ongoing issue with HIEs.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,550
So we will now consider how technology might make them more

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,000
sustainable or possibly unnecessary in the future.
