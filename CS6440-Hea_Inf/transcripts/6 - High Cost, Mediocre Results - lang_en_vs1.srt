00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,742
Americans often hear that we have the world's best healthcare system.

2
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:08,440
This is Dr. Brant James a

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,715
distinguished expert on healthcare quality at Intermountain Healthcare,

4
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:14,920
which is widely regarded as one of

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,258
the premier healthcare delivery systems in the United States.

6
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:21,970
Years ago he gave me the data for this graphic that shows that the

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,043
U.S. has the lowest mortality rates for high technology medicine,

8
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,657
the kind of care you need after a heart attack or major trauma.

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:32,706
That's the positive part of the story.

10
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,380
A Commonwealth Fund is

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,595
a private foundation that promotes a high performing healthcare system,

12
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:41,935
particularly for our most vulnerable citizens.

13
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:46,890
This graphic from its international research program shows that while the U.S. spends

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,380
around twice as much per capita on healthcare as six other industrialized nations.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,864
Our overall rank is at the bottom on quality access efficiency and equity of care.

16
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,860
Our citizens also rank at the bottom with

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,440
respect to living long, healthy productive lives.
