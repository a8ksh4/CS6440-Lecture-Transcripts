1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,045
Standards evolved over many years to encompass more aspects of medicine,

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,543
to code them in more detail,

3
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:10,615
and to adapt as technology changed.

4
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:14,250
We will divide this evolution into three dimensions.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,760
Structure, purpose, and technology.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,558
We will discuss the first two in this segment,

7
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:23,565
and technology evolution in the next one.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,030
The structure of standards has evolved in

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,300
large part to take advantage of the capabilities of computing.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,140
Early data standards were lists such as medical diagnoses,

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,380
laboratory tests, or medications.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,425
We will refer to those list standards as classifications.

13
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,515
As the use of computers and health care grew,

14
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,550
so did interest in the standards community to describe

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,995
more detail and to represent relationships among clinical concepts.

16
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:59,075
We will refer to a standard that can code for relationships as an ontology.

17
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,660
The goal here is often semantic interoperability,

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,970
as we saw in Lesson two.

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,675
You may remember this graph of clinical relationships from the Applicadia video,

20
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,720
and their nuanced multi-layered representation of

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,800
clinical details, concepts, and relationships.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,685
Note here that Applicadia is using both ICD-10 and SNOMED to represent concepts.

23
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,475
These are both ontologies that are able to represent

24
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:33,395
concepts relationships which is at the core of what Applicadia is trying to do.

25
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:37,210
The purpose of standards has also evolved.

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,725
Pre-computing, all of the early standards were for data.

27
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,195
Physicians would use the International Classification of Disease,

28
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:49,330
ICD, in their charting, primarily for billing.

29
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,214
The clinical laboratory would use a classification with the acronym,

30
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,598
LOIC, for their tests.

31
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:57,120
And the pharmacy would use one of

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,610
several relatively simple classifications to represent the medications they dispensed.

33
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,240
In the 1980s, computers were increasingly installed by hospitals.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,665
The focus was largely on the revenue producing departments such as billing,

35
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:16,915
laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology.

36
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:20,895
They and the nurses stations where orders originate,

37
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,980
and to wish results are sent,

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,240
needed to share information.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,650
Often, each of these departments was using a specialized,

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,105
independently developed, not interoperable proprietary software module.

41
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:40,630
This led to the formation of HL7 and the development of its messaging standards.

42
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,540
Using this technology, a physician could

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,015
order a lab test or medication at the nurses' station.

44
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,225
And as shown here,

45
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:54,370
that order could go electronically to the clinical laboratory to do the test,

46
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,495
or to the pharmacy to deliver the medication.

47
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:59,050
In the case of a test,

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,585
the results could come back to the nurses' station

49
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:05,115
using a different message from the same standard.

50
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:08,500
The next evolution was standards for clinical documents.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,740
A message would typically be an order for a single lab tests or medication.

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,210
However, the physician who would care for a patient after hospital discharge,

53
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,215
requires a complete summary of that patient's care.

54
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,020
This is the role of document standards.

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,265
You worked with one of them,

56
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:31,580
the HL7 CCD, in the health fault exercise.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,598
As is often the case with standards,

58
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,970
more than one was developed by different organizations, as shown here.

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,150
Today, they've been reconciled into

60
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,310
the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture, or CCDA.

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,550
However, you may still run into a CCR,

62
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,295
CDA, or C32 formatted clinical document.

63
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:58,160
More recently, as computers have become even more powerful,

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,350
standards have been evolving to represent clinical processes and workflows.

65
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,235
We will not cover these standards in any detail,

66
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,960
but IHE is an initiative by healthcare professionals and

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,975
industry to improve the way computer systems and healthcare share information.

68
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:18,642
Here's an example from IHE of schedule workflow,

69
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,975
SWF, that integrates the ordering,

70
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:25,695
scheduling, imaging acquisition, storage,

71
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:29,828
and viewing activities associated with radiology exams.

72
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:33,150
Analysis of this workflow leads to identification of

73
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,260
the actors and transactions needed to accomplish the task.

74
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,790
Properly implemented, these standards could provide benefits including

75
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,850
greater efficiency and a reduction in errors

76
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,585
caused by unnecessary variations in patient care.

77
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:54,207
Implementation does involve many areas of the hospital and many systems,

78
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,215
so it requires a concerted effort.

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,152
Nevertheless, given the cost of modern imaging equipment,

80
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,925
this is a good use case.

81
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:06,240
The IHE radiology group says that hundreds of

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,410
commercial radiology-related information systems have incorporated its solutions.
