1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,255
The final dimension of standard's evolution is technology.

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:08,027
Early messaging standards used EDI/X12,

3
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:13,070
itself a standard that had evolved in other industries to automate business processes,

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,595
such as ordering, invoicing, and payment.

5
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:19,825
EDI/X12 dates from the early days of computing,

6
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,035
when memory and storage were dear.

7
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,310
So, as you saw earlier,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,785
it is quite cryptic and compact.

9
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,440
With some effort, you could tell that the message

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,155
involved a clinical lab doing an HIV test.

11
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,190
The results were in red,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,970
but most of the other details would not be obvious without a guide.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,750
Here's an example of one.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,850
You may recall that in the discussion of HIPAA,

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,910
you learn that a primary reason for the law was to move

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,620
the industry to electronic financial and administrative transactions.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,975
A key example of that is the ANSI 837 electronic claim,

18
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:03,630
that is also in the EDI/X12 format used by HL-7 messages.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,375
This is a small part of a guide to the 837 format.

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,280
Newer messaging and document standards use XML,

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,515
a more modern syntax that is verbose,

22
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:18,800
but has the advantages that it is more human readable,

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,235
and can be rendered in a browser.

24
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:25,150
You saw that in the HealthVault exercise.

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,340
Here's a lab test in the newer HL7 V.3 XML format.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,015
While it is still not particularly readable,

27
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:39,135
we can more easily tell that it is a blood glucose level after 12 hours of fasting,

28
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:43,765
and its value of 182 is high as indicated by the age.

29
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:49,000
We can also see that the normal range for this test is 70 to 105.
