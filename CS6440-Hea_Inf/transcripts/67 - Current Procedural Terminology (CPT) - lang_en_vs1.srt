00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Current Procedural Terminology or CPT is a classification of

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,555
medical procedures maintained and updated annually by the American Medical Association.

3
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:14,720
Like ICD, it is required for virtually all reimbursement.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,240
CPT code is divided into three categories.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,780
Category 1 codes are five digit numbers for

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,540
widely performed procedures and are divided into sections for anaesthesiology,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,140
surgery, radiology, pathology in clinical medicine, and medicine.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,670
Category 2 codes are for the collection of quality and performance metrics,

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,835
and are four digits followed by an F.

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:48,240
Category 3 codes are also four digits followed by an I,

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,855
and are temporary to allow for new or experimental procedures.

12
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:55,900
Each code has a full, medium,

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,780
and short description as you can see here,

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,215
by the various levels of detail for naming a flu vaccination for different purposes.

15
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,260
Given its use in billing,

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,035
a CPT code may provide details necessary to determine the proper charge.

17
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:14,860
Here, codes for a psychotherapy visit indicate

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,275
the length of the visit and the amount a provider patient interaction.

19
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:23,695
That charge would be more or less depending on the code used.

20
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,260
Here are the factors that determine the code,

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,295
and hence the charge for an initial patient office visit.

22
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:35,805
Clearly, there is some subjectivity to the selection of the code.

23
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,785
CPT codes may appear to be simple,

24
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:44,335
but given their critical role in billing and subtleties such as we have discussed,

25
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:47,007
selection of the right code is important,

26
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,995
and billing personnel require training to code correctly.

27
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,925
The goal typically is to submit the largest,

28
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:56,000
but, hopefully, legitimate bill.
