Lack of health insurance can increase health care costs.

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,610
This map shows that other than the U.S. virtually all developed

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,538
nations have universal health care that covers everyone.

4
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:18,070
The Affordable Care Act's major coverage provisions went into effect in

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,760
January 2014 and have led to significant coverage gains,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,030
but as of the end of

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:31,295
2016 estimates were that around 30 million Americans were still uninsured.

is the health care arm of the National Academy of Science,

00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,250
which was founded in 1863 under President Lincoln.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,605
According to the IOM the uninsured on average use

13
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:51,670
less health care than do insured persons and members of fully insured families.

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,579
That's lost utilization may be hidden from view,

00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:02,000
but it can prove costly in terms of subs with ill health disability and premature death.
