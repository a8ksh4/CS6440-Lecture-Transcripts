00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,027
The development of the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, or SNOMED,

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08,715
traces its roots to a project began in the 1960s

3
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,640
by Dr. Arnold Pratt at the National Institutes of Health,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,510
or NIH, to use natural language processing to

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,325
machine code pathologist free-text dictated notes.

6
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,250
Thus, from the outset,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,360
it was an ontology representing relationships among its concepts.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,740
Today, it extends to all of medicine and is maintained by

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,920
the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO).

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,550
SNOMED is huge and complex.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,930
The most recent US version of it,

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,700
SNOMED CT subset for clinical medicine,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,880
still has over 311,000 concepts with over 1.3 million relationships among them.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,195
Given its scope, you may find references to SNOMED CT in many types of FHIR resources.

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:08,430
In this course, we'll focus only on SNOMED CT. Concepts are

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,470
the basic component of SNOMED CT and have

17
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,600
a unique nine-digit SNOMED CT identifier or SCTID.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:25,039
Each SNOMED CT concept also has a unique human-readable Fully Specified Name or FSN.

19
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,590
Here, I have used

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,760
the official IHTSDO SNOMED CT browser to search for the term hypertension.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,720
I got 705 matches and selected one of

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,205
several that has a Fully Specified Name of hypertensive disorder,

23
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:48,943
systemic arterial, which I'll just call hypertension in what follows.

24
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:55,240
Its SCTID is 38341003.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,865
Here, you see the 14 synonyms for hypertension.

26
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:03,130
This list could be quite useful in processing text notes or problems from

27
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,980
a structured list and might contain one or more of these alternative terms.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,106
You can also see the hierarchical nature of SNOMED CT.

29
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:17,290
Hypertension is a child of disorders of cardiovascular system that is

30
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,650
a child of disorder of body system and so on all the way to the top of the hierarchy.

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,730
Any intermediate level of this hierarchy could

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,685
be useful in grouping patients for analysis.

33
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:34,930
Hypertension, in turn, has 23 sub-disorders called children.

34
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,990
These can also be useful for grouping patients for analysis.

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,435
The browser also provides a diagrammatic hierarchical view.

36
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:47,730
A careful look at this shows how SNOMED explicitly

37
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,109
reveals important computable clinical relationships.

38
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,730
Absent this, how might a computer know that

39
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,705
hypertension is associated with an increased blood pressure?

40
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:59,370
Here's a second, more interesting,

41
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,297
example for prolapse of the mitral valve due to rheumatic disease.

42
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,700
A physician would know that

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,750
the root cause was a streptococcal infection that triggered the body

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,630
to attack the heart valve because of the similarity of some of

45
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,130
its surface proteins to those of the bacteria.

46
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,985
How would a computer know this?

47
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,370
SNOMED makes it explicit.

48
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,130
Finally, the references view provides a great deal of

49
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,260
potentially useful information in the form of

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,505
relationships between the current concept and others.

51
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,700
You can see that they are in five groups,

52
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,570
we will discuss only the first two but I would suggest you explore the others.

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,600
Associated findings are clinical findings that might

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,230
occur with hypertension such as a family history of the disease.

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,490
Associated with, are clinical findings that hypertension patients may have.

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,840
I've expanded that view here to show, for example,

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,065
that they might have one or more of a number of kidney diseases

58
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,920
that can cause or be caused by high hypertension.

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,404
Again, this is potentially very useful information for analysis of clinical data.

60
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:11,420
SNOMED is quite a bit more complex than I've presented here in this brief overview.

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,000
Nevertheless, I hope I've been able to convince you that it can be a very valuable tool.
