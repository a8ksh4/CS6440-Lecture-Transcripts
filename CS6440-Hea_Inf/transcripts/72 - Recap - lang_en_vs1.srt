00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
You now have an overview of how standards have evolved over

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,125
the years in terms of their structure, purpose and technology.

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:12,665
You should think about the difference between simpler classifications such as NDC,

4
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:19,925
CPT and ICD prior to version 10 and a complex ontology such as SNOMAD.

5
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:24,240
The standards community has struggled over the tension between perfection,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,100
a standard that can represent medicine all of its detail and practicality,

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,408
standards that can actually be deployed and used in the real world.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,815
This dichotomy extends equally to the topic of our next lesson,

9
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:42,145
interoperability standards, and it eventually lead to fire,

10
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,000
the subject of the following lesson.
