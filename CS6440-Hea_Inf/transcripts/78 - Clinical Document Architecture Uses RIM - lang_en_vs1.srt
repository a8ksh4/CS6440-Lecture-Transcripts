1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,445
The Clinical Document Architecture or CDA define HL7 V3

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:08,880
RIM-based documents assembled from

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,515
administrative and clinical data for particular purposes.

4
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:16,790
You saw one of these when you did the HealthVault CCD activity.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,325
You should also recall that a consolidation effort produced

6
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:26,105
the newer CCDA or Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture standard.

7
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:30,690
Here's the first part of the CDA you used in the HealthVault activity.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,920
I have highlighted instances where it refers to the RIM.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,140
I leave it to you to consider the tradeoffs between value,

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,120
complexity and ease of implementation that this reliance on RIM brings with it.
