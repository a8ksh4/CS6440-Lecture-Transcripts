00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
The Kaiser Family Foundation is

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,800
a nonprofit organization focusing on national health issues,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,050
as well as the U.S. role in global health policy.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,070
This 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation data shows

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,600
that uninsured people receive substantially less healthcare than the insured.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,245
This 2015 data shows that the uninsured are likely to have no regular source of care,

7
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:33,145
to postpone or do without needed care,

8
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:38,915
or to postpone or not get needed prescriptions due to cost.

9
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,720
Kaiser Family Foundation goes on to say that

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,580
insured and uninsured people who are injured or newly diagnosed with a chronic condition,

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,890
such as diabetes or hypertension,

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,140
receive similar plans for follow-up care from their physician.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,285
People without health coverage are less likely to obtain

14
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,720
all the recommended services than those with coverage.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,600
Finally, because the uninsured are less likely to have regular outpatient care,

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,560
they are more likely to end up with expensive hospitalizations for

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,910
avoidable health problems and to experienced declines in their overall health.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,170
When hospitalized, uninsured people receive

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,035
fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services

20
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:24,290
and have higher mortality rates than those with insurance.
