1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,785
Clinical Decision Support or CDS is

2
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:08,435
an early and particularly interesting domain within Health Informatics.

3
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:11,200
Its purpose is to provide clinicians, patients,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,350
and others with knowledge and personalize information,

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,960
intelligently filtered or presented at

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,205
appropriate times to enhance health and health care.

7
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:25,710
According to ONC, "CDS tools include

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,535
computerized alerts and reminders to care providers and patients, clinical guidelines,

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:36,955
condition-specific order sets, focused patient data reports and summaries,

10
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:41,055
documentation templates, diagnostic support,

11
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:45,080
and contextually relevant reference information, among other tools."

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,715
We will discuss three key clinical decision support projects to illustrate

13
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:54,250
how early researchers recognized it as

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,985
an opportunity and the challenges to successfully implementing it in practice.

15
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:05,840
My purpose in placing this discussion here is to set the stage for appreciating how

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,530
two key capabilities of FHIR and SMART on FHIR are making clinical decision support,

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,690
a far more approachable and clinically-useful tool.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,162
The first is facile retrieval of EHR data in a standard format,

19
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:26,310
facilitating the integration of FHIR apps into any EHR.

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,955
This also obviates the need for any redundant data entry by the provider.

21
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:35,989
The second is seamless integration into the provider's workflow,

22
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:42,670
making the use of clinical decision support far more efficient and therefore more likely.

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,330
Finally, this discussion will expose you to some of what I consider the most fascinating

24
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,000
parts of the history of Health Informatics and the vision of some of its pioneers.
