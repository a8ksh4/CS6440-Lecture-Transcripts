1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Yet, another early example of clinical decisions support was Internists,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,710
developed starting in 1974 at the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. Jack Myers,

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,570
an internal medicine physician,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,745
and Dr. Harry E. Pople,

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:19,050
a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,559
Health Informatics is often the first place the new computer science technique appears,

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,190
but according to Volume 64 of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,110
"Applying abduction to artificial intelligence problems began with

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,720
Harry Pople and his system, internist."

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,430
In 1985, book, Logic of Discovery and Diagnosis in Medicine,

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,932
describes the program as,

12
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:48,370
"an AI partial simulation of Dr. Myers

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,469
clinical reasoning using his own internal knowledge base".

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,760
The goal of internists was to make

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,180
the appropriate diagnosis in a given clinical situation.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,745
In that same book,

17
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:06,875
Dr. Pople describes the methods used and I will summarize his chapter here.

18
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:11,350
He explains why a Belgian approach or a branching logic,

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,955
essentially a network approach that starts with a presenting complaint, as shown here,

20
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:21,380
is inadequate to deal with the real world of clinical diagnoses where

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,105
new or conflicting data may arrive too late to assist with an interim decision,

22
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:28,430
and it may even arrive in random order.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,005
Internist contained a knowledge-base consisting of some 500 disease entities,

24
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,185
organized into categories by disease system,

25
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:42,200
and there are over 3000 clinical manifestations.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,110
This diagram of liver diseases and their related conditions and

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,860
manifestations illustrates these relationships,

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,180
and is from a chapter by Dr. Pople in the 1982 book,

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,665
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

30
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:01,400
You can see that each disease entity has a corresponding list of manifestations,

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,110
weighted on a scale of one to five,

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,904
based on the frequency of their occurrence in that disease.

33
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:11,500
Inversely, a scale of zero to five reflected

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,590
the strength of the association of manifestations to diseases.

35
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,065
Finally, there was a representation of causal,

36
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,300
temporal, and other relationships among entities.

37
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,190
This structure is in many ways,

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,310
suggestive of a SNOMED whose predecessor, SNOP,

39
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,585
was by then an operation at NIH but I don't know if the Internist team was aware of that.

40
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:39,420
Internists ranked disease entities that explain any or all of a patients findings,

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,315
reflecting their goodness of fit to the data.

42
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,567
It then formulated questions for the physician,

43
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:49,920
as shown here, to discriminate among the equally-ranked entities.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,180
In this example, the computer is considering the diagnosis of

45
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,908
acute Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy or DIC,

46
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,370
a dangerous, potentially life-threatening

47
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,280
condition in which blood clots form in the small blood vessels.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,641
Much like an attending physician might do on rounds with physicians in training,

49
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,240
it is asking for the results of

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,340
the pertinent laboratory tests to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

51
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,920
Once a diagnosis was considered identified,

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,670
it was added to the patient's problem list.

53
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,890
Its manifestations were considered accounted for,

54
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,470
and the process repeated.

55
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,810
While Internists worked, in complex cases,

56
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,050
they are often considered inappropriate possibilities and

57
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,095
wasted clinician's time answering questions with respect to that.

58
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:48,040
To overcome this, Internist-II used the heuristic that recognize that

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,050
certain manifestations are distinctly

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,250
characteristic of a disease or category of diseases.

61
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,915
Jaundice, which is prominent in this diagram we just saw,

62
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,700
is highly suggestive of

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,005
liver disease so the initial focus in a patient with this symptom,

64
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,840
should be on this disease category as it

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,025
would be if a physician were making the diagnosis.

66
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:14,995
Internist-II also introduced a multi problem generator.

67
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:20,075
Essentially, a search process beginning globally with health problems as shown here.

68
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:25,730
It terminated when at least one problem hypothesis accounted for all clinical findings.

69
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,355
However, that hypothesis might or might not specify specific diseases.

70
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,184
If there were sufficient cues in the data,

71
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:40,205
further hypothesis reduction could reduce the possibilities to specific problems.

72
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:45,035
Finally, if further reduced the problem list by exploiting its database of causal,

73
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,230
temporal, and other relationships,

74
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,210
yet another process, analogous to what actual physicians do.
