1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,330
The basic Arden unit is Medical Logic Modules,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:10,200
MLMs, each of which contains sufficient knowledge to make a single clinical decision.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,445
As illustrated here, MLMs used the Backus-Naur form, BNF,

4
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:18,240
a notation for context-free grammars,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,455
otherwise used to describe the syntax of computer programming languages,

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:26,755
document formats, instruction sets, and communication protocols.

7
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:31,475
Each MLM can have four categories of information.

8
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:36,730
Maintenance, Library, Knowledge, and Resources.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,295
This example from Dr. Ribshek illustrates two of these,

10
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:42,785
and I've highlighted them in yellow for you.

11
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,925
Here in the library category,

12
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,915
you see that the purpose of this MLM is to check

13
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:52,645
each new penicillin prescription for a penicillin allergy.

14
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,115
Here in the knowledge category,

15
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:56,580
you see that the triggering event is that

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,215
the newly prescribed medication belongs to the penicillin class.

17
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:06,400
Of course, the way to determine that might well be EHR-specific.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,220
Here you see the logic to evaluate the decision,

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,205
and here, the action to take if its value is true.

20
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:21,510
There is now an Arden XML schema and this diagram of it details all four categories.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,570
In addition to the two categories we saw earlier,

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,540
each MLM also contains management information to help maintain

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,345
the knowledge base of MLMs and links to other knowledge resources.

24
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:36,900
Health personnel can create MLMs and implement them in

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,115
any EHR or clinical information system that conforms to the Arden specification.

26
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:47,430
Keep in mind that each MLM can drive one decision,

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,030
so in practice, a group of MLMs may be required.

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,350
Here, five MLMs help provide clinical decision support for the use of warfarin,

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,170
a common but potentially dangerous blood thinner often

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,315
given to patients after thrombotic strokes caused by clots,

31
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:09,250
or to treat other potential blood clotting problems.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,525
Too little of the drug may mean another stroke,

33
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:16,390
too much can cause excessive and even fatal bleeding.

34
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,485
Warfarin interacts with many other drugs and even the patient's diet,

35
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,050
so it is a tricky drug to manage.

36
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,460
Physicians use a test called PT/INR to assess the degree

37
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,825
of blood thinning to manage the warfarin dose in each patient.

38
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,965
You can see here that the modules,

39
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:39,450
using clinical data about the patient including their PT/INR,

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,700
can make warfarin dosage recommendations.

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,510
This part of the MLM specifically deals with a lab test,

42
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,440
the creatinine level, that measures kidney function.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,920
It is important to know the patient's kidney function

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,580
before giving the dye because the kidneys remove the dye,

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,170
and it can cause kidney damage.

46
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,260
As a result, Arden needs to know the creatinine level.

47
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,150
And to get it, dam = PDQRES2 in curly braces, highlighted here,

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,390
must be interpreted by the EHR in

49
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,225
a particular hospital to fetch that value from its proprietary database.

50
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:25,145
The purpose of Arden is to share clinical decision support logic,

51
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,555
but because EHR have not been regularly interoperable,

52
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:35,020
the work involved in implementing Arden locally has led to low Arden adoption.

53
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,435
This impediment is so serious and widely known that it even has a name,

54
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:43,355
a curly braces problem.

55
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:47,330
This leads us to one of the key advantages of FHIR that I

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,395
mentioned earlier as a reason for this discussion of clinical decision support.

57
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:57,890
FHIR-enabled EHRs would present creatinine in a consistent form,

58
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,015
as a FHIR observation resource.

59
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:06,636
As a result, a hypothetical clinical decision support FHIR app

60
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:12,940
need have no knowledge of the EHR's internal data structure or representation.

61
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,450
It would not need to be adapted to each EHR,

62
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,600
greatly reducing development cost and facilitating implementation and hence,

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,805
the likelihood of clinical decision support adoption.

64
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:30,365
We will discuss integration with workflow and process.

65
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:33,710
The second major advantage of FHIR and SMART on FHIR

66
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,000
in support of clinical decision support in the next lesson.
