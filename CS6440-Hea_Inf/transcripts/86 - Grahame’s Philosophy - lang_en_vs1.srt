1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Grahame's vision guides FHIR development.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,700
So, before we delve into the standard,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,080
it's important to understand his philosophy.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,403
The FHIR Data Model consists of resources as Grahame propose for RFH.

5
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:18,910
Unlike HL7's CCDA and RIM,

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,585
resource contents are intentionally limited.

7
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:28,330
FHIR's 80% rule is the operative guideline and it informally states that

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,505
each resource should contain

9
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:36,910
only those data elements needed for 80% or more of its anticipated use cases.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,770
Of course, as Grahame has posted,

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,235
there are other considerations such as safety and consistency.

12
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:50,480
All standards efforts must grapple with tension between comprehensiveness and usability.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,785
In essence, this approach means that in FHIR,

14
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:56,645
usability is a top priority.

15
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:00,930
Grahame's second principle is around how to verify the standard.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,075
Historically, a vote of standards developers approves the standard they created.

17
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:12,230
Input from software developers who have worked with proposed FHIR resources,

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,665
APIs, and other elements of the standard guides further development of FHIR.

19
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:21,305
Again, usability is a priority.

20
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:23,420
The third principle is the use of

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,980
Cross Industry Web Technologies to search for resources and to create,

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,585
read, update, and delete them, CRUD, C-R-U-D.

23
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:35,040
This makes the standard more approachable and hence,

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,335
more attractive to modern developers,

25
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:44,120
and provides the basis for FHIR base mobile and web apps that can be EHR-agnostic.
