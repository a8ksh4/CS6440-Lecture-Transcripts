1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
The FHIR data model is instantiated in a set of what will

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,675
probably be some 150 or more modular resources.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,870
The current release 3 version of the standard organizes

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,535
its 117 resources and related documentation in the five levels you see here.

5
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:25,265
Level 1 is the standard's basic framework and consists of 30 resources.

6
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:28,900
Level 2 supports implementation and binding to

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,330
external specifications and contains 26 resources.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,900
Level 3 provides structural and process elements of

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,150
real world healthcare systems and provides 37 resources.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:50,240
Level 4 is for record keeping and data exchange and contains 13 resources.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,870
Level 5 provides the ability to reason about

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,800
healthcare processes and contains 11 resources.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,570
It is likely that the number of resources will increase,

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,910
and existing ones may change over time.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,590
So, I provide a link to the resource index page on the FHIR site.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,890
It summarizes the resources and their subdivisions in several useful ways.

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,665
Note the number after each resource indicates its maturity on a scale of zero to five.

18
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:26,795
These numbers will also increase over time as standards definition proceeds.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,835
At present, the lower levels are generally more mature.

20
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:35,775
We cannot cover FHIR comprehensively in this survey course,

21
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:40,695
so I can't overemphasize the importance of studying the excellent,

22
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:46,125
well-organized FHIR website to gain a fuller understanding of the standard.

23
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,230
To get you started on that,

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,815
here are a few particularly interesting resources.

25
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:57,075
The definition of a resource is itself contained in the resource resource,

26
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,415
in the foundational framework part of the foundational level.

27
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:07,245
Earlier, I said that valuesets can be represented in a resource.

28
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:13,605
It is the valueset resource in the terminology division of the foundational level.

29
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:16,875
Later, we will discuss FHIR profiles.

30
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,560
The structured definition resource in

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,865
the conformance division of the second implementation level represents profiles.

32
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:30,910
The group resource in the third level specifies a particular set of patients,

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,175
providers, medications, and so on,

34
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:36,480
for purposes such as reporting or tracking.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,980
The subscription resource in

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,490
the other division at the foundational level is used to create

37
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,590
a push of FHIR resources that match criteria specified in the resource.

38
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,790
Finally, level 5 includes support for clinical reasoning.

39
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,620
Earlier, we discussed clinical decision support,

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,120
and I pointed to tight EHR integration as a benefit of

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,735
FHIR to obtain provider adoption of these tools.

42
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,400
The new CDS Hooks specification,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,510
developed by the same Harvard group that created SMART on FHIR,

44
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,795
supports the integration of clinical logic,

45
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:22,630
similar to what we saw with the Arden Syntax into EHRs in order to,

46
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,535
among other things, launch FHIR apps when

47
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:30,120
a patient's clinical situation suggests they might be of value.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,320
A goal of FHIR release 4 is to unify

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,150
the CDS Hooks specification with the clinical reasoning module.

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,485
This should be another important step toward broader use of clinical decision support.

51
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,110
When I last asked Graham,

52
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,575
he estimated that the first normative version of the standard might appear in 2018.

53
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:58,050
Until then, FHIR is a Standard for Trial Use, STU.

54
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,870
You may see the term Draft Standard for Trial Use, or DSTU,

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,000
but STU is now HL7s preferred designation.
