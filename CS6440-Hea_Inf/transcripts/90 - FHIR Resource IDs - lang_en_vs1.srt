1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
FHIR resources have a logical identity or ID that is

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,330
unique among all resources of the same type on each FHIR server.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,620
Just to be clear,

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,510
the patient resource ID will usually be different on each FHIR server,

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,785
so it cannot establish patient identity across servers.

6
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:25,915
However, there is a discussion of the use of FHIR for

7
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:32,190
a master patient index on the patient resource page of the FHIR website.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,440
And there is even this value set to indicate the quality of a patient query match.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,410
I mention this as much as anything to show you how rich the FHIR standard is

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,220
becoming and to urge you to explore it further.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,295
Here, further down in the allergy resource we've been exploring,

12
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:54,625
you see references by ID to the patient,

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:59,995
"example" who has this allergy as well as to the practitioner,

14
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:02,220
"13" who recorded it.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,775
These references can be absolute or relative.

16
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,725
Once assigned, the identity is never changed.

17
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,400
However, a copy of that resource on

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,335
another server might not be able to retain the same logical identity.

19
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:21,545
As shown here via these references,

20
00:01:21,545 --> 00:01:25,555
FHIR resources create a network of information.

21
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:29,280
The unique identifier of a resource instance is

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,690
an absolute URI constructed from the server base address,

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,890
the resource type, and the logical ID.

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,490
When the literal identity is an HTTP address,

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,605
this address can generally retrieve or manipulate the resource,

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,740
as I illustrate here using the public HAPI, H-A-P-I, FHIR server.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,320
Here are the three parts of the URL.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,909
The server base address of fhirtest.uhn.ca,

29
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,790
the resource type of

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:09,435
baseDstu2/Patient that combines the resource type with the version of FHIR,

31
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:15,365
and the resource ID of 3535.

32
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:18,165
Finally, here you see that as it should,

33
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:23,706
the internal reference to the FHIR ID matches the one in the URL.

34
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:26,140
You should easily be able to do the same

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,530
using the Georgia Tech or any public FHIR service.

36
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,237
Simply search for a resource and then note

37
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:37,320
its literal URL and the three parts that make it up.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,655
Before moving on, note the use of DSTU in the URL we just looked at.

39
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:46,740
As I said earlier,

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,300
you're likely to run into this,

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,463
even though the preferred term is now STU.

42
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:54,955
They are equivalent.

43
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,880
Note that implementation should not assume that

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,435
the identity of a resource is always resolvable to a literal server.

45
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:07,360
It may be temporarily unavailable or may not be available by policy,

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,490
such as firewalls or in some cases it may not actually exist,

47
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,685
such as the use of resources outside of a RESTful environment.

48
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:20,770
Logical ID literal references are case sensitive.

49
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,070
They can be up to 64 characters long and

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,405
contain any combination of upper and lower case ASCII characters,

51
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:31,345
numerals, dashes, and periods,

52
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:36,385
as illustrated by the patient ID of "example" we saw earlier.

53
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:40,430
I have posted a link to a video that demonstrates

54
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,230
the use of clinFHIR to create FHIR resources.

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:52,115
ClinFHIR is an excellent open public comprehensive FHIR resource created by David Hay,

56
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,645
a leader in the FHIR community.

57
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,000
I strongly recommend you explore it.
