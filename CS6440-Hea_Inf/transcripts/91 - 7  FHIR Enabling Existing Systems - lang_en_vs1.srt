1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
In a real world scenario,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,285
health system vendors usually create Fire resources from data stored

3
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:12,585
in a proprietary database designed and built before Fire existed.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:18,565
When a Fire app or a REST API ask for a resource,

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:24,340
special software often called a Fire adapter or server must know how to

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,895
get data elements from that database and package them into the Fire resource format.

7
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:34,230
The data that populates that Fire resource will therefore

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,555
depend on the underlying system.

9
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:41,900
If that system stores clinical observations only as text,

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,480
then even though Fire specifies them,

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,365
LOINC codes will not be available in the Fire resources that system creates.

12
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:52,690
Alternately, the design is so the Fire adapter

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,330
might make the effort to add any missing codes.

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,890
In either case, there is no assurance that

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,455
different EHRs represent or code a concept the same way.

16
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:09,320
Many major healthcare enterprise software vendors including Epic, Cerner and Meditech,

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,875
the three most widely installed,

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,020
have released at least a preliminary Fire server,

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,525
sometimes with integrated support for the Smart and Fire applet form.

20
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:22,885
We will look at the examples of this later on.

21
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:25,440
Finally, again at present,

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,340
most vendor support is for the reading of resources.

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,795
Support for the rest of CRUD is more difficult for vendors to implement

24
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:38,835
because of the need to verify the various checks and safeguards used in their systems.

25
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,430
This will come later if at all.

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,670
HL7 maintains a web page that summarizes the ever growing list of

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,935
health IT system vendors and

28
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:54,750
other organizations interested in Fire along with a link to their site,

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,000
contact information and a brief description of their intended use of the standard.
