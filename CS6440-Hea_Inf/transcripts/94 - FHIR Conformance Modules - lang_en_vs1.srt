1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
The capabilities operation in the whole system section retrieves

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,795
the server's capability statement resource

3
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:12,869
describing its current operational functionality.

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,940
As shown here, using

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,723
Graham Greeves interesting tabular presentation for human consumption,

6
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:23,220
clients connecting to a FHIR server can use the capabilities

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,575
interaction to check whether they are version and or feature compatible with the server.

8
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:34,640
Beyond this, FHIR provides a set of resources to represent and share

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,145
the adaptations made in a particular server in a computable fashion.

10
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,440
Adaptations might include restrictions such as

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,470
allowed values within a value set specified in the standard.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,615
Alternatively, they might specify another value set that is more

13
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:56,580
expensive or that it is necessary in a special context.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,430
For example, the value sets for the specification of ethnicity differ among countries.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,210
Data elements can be required and extensions can be added.

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,805
This set of resources form the conformance module as shown here.

17
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:18,180
The conformance resources can be used in isolation but they are typically used in

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,455
the context of an Implementation Guide as shown in the center of this diagram.

19
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:29,550
Implementation Guides are documents published by a domain, institution,

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,610
or vendor that described how FHIR is

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,935
adapted to support a certain use case or set of use cases.

22
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:41,215
An Implementation Guide combines a set of conformance resources

23
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:45,960
and supporting narrative into a document to be used by implementors.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,990
A good example of an Implementation Guide is the DAF,

25
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,050
Data Access Framework to the FHIR specification that specifies access to

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,050
patient data for EHR systems to meet

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,000
the requirements of meaningful use and related federal regulations.
