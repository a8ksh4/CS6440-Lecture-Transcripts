1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,030
I took a Doctoral degree in what was then called,

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,875
Computer Science, in between med school and residency.

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:23,380
It was a hobby because no one could imagine why a doctor would want a computer.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,280
So as I practiced in the academic environment for the next 25 or 30 years,

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:38,430
most of the interest came peripherally about the application of computers to health care.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:50,500
I began my career in Medical Informatics full time about 20 years ago.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,210
In today's world, we are burdened with

8
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,300
far too much information to make adequate decisions in a timely manner,

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,850
be accurate, up to date and appropriate for the patient.

10
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,110
We come to the decision process ill prepared to take care of our patients.

11
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:27,710
The technology now is able to provide us the kinds of support we need to reduce errors,

12
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,960
improve the care of patients and diminish skyrocketing cost.

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,530
HL7 began 31 years ago in a classroom

14
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,250
at the University of Pennsylvania with one goal in mind,

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,040
improving access to admission data.

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:59,480
Quickly, it evolved into clinical information and began a journey to try to enable

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,720
the sharing of data in a large ubiquitous environment that could

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:15,715
be seamless and yet deeply integrated with the way we care for patients.

19
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:23,963
Quickly, it was recognized that this is not simply a US centric process and

20
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:32,223
members of HL7 identify themselves all over the world.

21
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:42,140
And now we have members in 35 countries in every continent representing the,

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,530
sometimes local needs but often the global needs for care, public health,

23
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:58,660
research and the very core kinds of competencies that are fundamental for better health.

24
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,575
Six years ago, we began a program called Fresh Look.

25
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:10,015
What if we could start all over,

26
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:15,230
reinvent HL7 but careful to acknowledge

27
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,163
all the things we had learned about what we did right and what we had done not so right?

28
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:30,853
At that program, Graham Griff presented his vision for health care and operability,

29
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:36,855
which quickly was transformed into what we now envision in FHIR.

30
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:42,005
And although the adoption process was not immediate,

31
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:51,425
universally it was recognized that this shared many of the common elements that have made

32
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:57,485
commerce information exchange and the sharing of data

33
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:04,340
in public communication so simple and straightforward.

34
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,290
That technology was leveraged and made part of the fundamental elements of FHIR.

35
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,325
I think perhaps more importantly,

36
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:16,230
was a different focus for FHIR.

37
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,785
Unlike some of the earlier HL7 standards,

38
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:27,470
FHIR was really made an important part of the implementation community.

39
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,490
We didn't focus simply on the individuals

40
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,060
and stakeholder groups that needed to use our standards,

41
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,365
but on the people who would be the providers and end users of a product,

42
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:50,080
for whom, this has been the greatest leap of value.

43
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,390
I think the visionaries who developed FHIR,

44
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,135
realized this from the very start.

45
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,200
I think acknowledgement by a larger community,

46
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,440
like any other new idea,

47
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,450
required time and a great deal of effort.

48
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,730
Part of that was made simple by two fundamental processes.

49
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,150
One, we didn't charge for FHIR.

50
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:28,490
And secondly, we allowed a broad international community to contribute not only

51
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:37,565
to the development of the FHIR standard but the implementation of FHIR as a tool.

52
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:43,775
It transcended any other activity in its ease of use,

53
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:51,040
its global recognition and its adoption by a diverse community.

54
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,375
Not only is it about caregivers but also the research community,

55
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:04,040
the organizations that rely on population health.

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,090
And in the United States,

57
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,590
where we have multi payer systems,

58
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,069
the payer communities who now need clinical data more than ever,

59
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:24,775
are embracing the ease and ubiquity of a FHIR platform.

60
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:30,570
Some segments, some stakeholder groups and some individuals,

61
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,115
were far slower than others.

62
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:39,900
I can tell you that I was pleasantly

63
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,915
surprised by the diverse stakeholder groups,

64
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,560
who found FHIR to be useful.

65
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,405
I think in the communities that are not easily changed,

66
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:58,600
there is always a hurdle.

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,704
Change management is one of the great obstacles,

68
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:05,695
whether in the private sector or the public one.

69
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:12,860
And I think the access that HL7 provided to FHIR,

70
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,625
the ease of acceptance,

71
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:26,320
really accelerated the process in ways that I never anticipated.

72
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:34,545
I wrote in the HR in 1981.

73
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,490
It served one business case,

74
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,905
physicians in an academic medical center couldn't find the chart.

75
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:48,070
The paper charts were distributed in a host of different places.

76
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,625
The electronic medical record,

77
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,865
if you want to call what I produced,

78
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:59,475
simply allowed continuity so you could find out what happened the last week.

79
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:04,410
FHIR presents a host of opportunities because for me,

80
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,060
an electronic medical record,

81
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,815
is a lot more than simply a tool to document care.

82
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:15,124
It's an open resource for

83
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:22,020
the kind of clinical decision support that is so paramount as we transition,

84
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,120
from physicians who could imagine all the things they needed

85
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,368
to know in a few concepts.

86
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,235
We're now exploding with information,

87
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:38,205
not just about the clinical condition,

88
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,305
the therapies, the guidelines,

89
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:45,240
but also in the broad field of genomics and proteomics,

90
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,536
which will bring us concepts that are really beyond what humans can consume.

91
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:54,075
So the decision process has eased.

92
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,540
The sharing of information for

93
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,900
a continuous learning system is enabled because the delays in bringing

94
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,090
new ideas and new concepts to

95
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,070
health care from the research community are far too slow and far too expensive.

96
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,880
And so, FHIR presents a unique bridge to go

97
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,900
from one stakeholder group to another and the information moves rather seamlessly.

98
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,150
In the ensuing decade,

99
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:38,775
I expect the number of pieces of data that any clinician needs to make a decision,

100
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:43,290
will be beyond human reasoning.

101
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,325
FHIR will enable the kind of integration of diverse data.

102
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:56,640
We will have platforms that we had not imagined.

103
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,910
In fact, we have a program which is unique in my experience,

104
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,805
in which stakeholders who have produced FHIR apps, showcase this.

105
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:14,280
Our FHIR app round table,

106
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,040
is one of the most enjoyable moments in my year,

107
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,480
in which I get to see the kinds of

108
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,695
ideas that are brought to the fore that I had never imagined you could do with data.

109
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:38,025
And more importantly, the developers of these products have an opportunity to

110
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:45,315
collaborate and bring yet unique ideas to the fore with an ease,

111
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:48,765
that I don't think even they imagined.

112
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:52,020
And I suspect that in the coming decade,

113
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:59,000
HL7 will be transformed into a facilitator of that process.
