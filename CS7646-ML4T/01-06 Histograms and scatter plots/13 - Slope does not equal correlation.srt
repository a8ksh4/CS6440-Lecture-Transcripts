1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,696
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC, and

2
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:03,455
again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC, and

3
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:04,837
we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

4
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,330
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,079
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC, and

6
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:10,766
again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC, and

7
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,879
we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

8
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,370
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.

9
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,800
The slope is just the slope.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,010
Correlation is a measure of

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,110
how tightly do these individual
points fit that line?

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,210
So you could have a shallow slope but

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,280
the data tightly fitting that line,
and thus a higher correlation.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,720
Or you could have a steeper line and

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,900
the data fitting that line
at a higher correlation.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,460
Correlation is just a measure of how
tightly do those dots fit the line.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,438
And you can have
a correlation from 0 to 1.

18
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:53,646
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC, and

19
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:55,503
again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC, and

20
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:56,963
we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

21
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,260
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,860
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC, and

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,070
again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC,

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,919
and we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

25
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,370
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.
