1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,690
Now consider rewards for our learner.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,610
Of course it makes sense that
rewards should relate in some

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,150
way to the returns of our strategy.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,565
There are at least two
approaches that we can utilize.

5
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:15,028
Short-term rewards in
terms of daily returns or

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:19,840
long-term rewards that reflect
the cumulative return of a trade cycle

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,540
from a buy to a sell, or for
shorting from a sell to a buy.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,510
So consider these two, daily returns,
where each day we get a reward

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,570
which is equal to the return
over the last day, or

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:41,900
a reward where our the reward is equal
to zero, until we exit the position.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,390
Then the cumulative return that we
gained across that whole trade.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,620
Which one of these do you think
will result in faster conversions?
