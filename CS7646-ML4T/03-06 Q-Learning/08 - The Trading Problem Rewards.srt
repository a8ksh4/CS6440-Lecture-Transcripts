1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,980
The correct answer is daily returns.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,790
The reason is, if you choose the other
one where we get no reward at

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,860
all until the end of a trade cycle,
from a buy to a sell.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,450
The learner has to infer from that
final reward all the way back,

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,250
that each action in sequence
there must have been accomplished

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,598
in the right order to get that reward.

7
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:31,720
If we reward a little bit each
on each day, the learner is

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,110
able to learn much more quickly because
it gets much more frequent rewards.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,060
This by the way,
is called delayed reward and

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,650
this is more of an immediate reward.
