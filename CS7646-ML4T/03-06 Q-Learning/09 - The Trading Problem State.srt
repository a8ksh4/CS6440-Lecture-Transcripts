00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,351
Now we come to the last thing we need to
solve in order to convert our trading

2
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:09,869
problem into a q learning problem,
and that is to define our state.

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,031
I want you to consider these factors and

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,970
let me know which ones you think
make sense to be in this state.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,400
Okay, so here are a few factors.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,290
Look at each one and

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,165
consider whether you think they
make sense to be in state.

8
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:27,620
And check the ones that
you think do make sense.
