1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,667
Adjusted close is not a good factor for
learning,

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:11,470
because you're not able to
generalize over different price

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,620
regimes for when the stock
was low to when it was high.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,770
Also, if you're trying
to learn a model for

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,250
several stocks at once and
they each hold very different prices,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,000
adjusted close doesn't serve
well to help you generalize.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,780
Same thing is true for
simple moving average.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,260
However if you combine adjusted close
and simple moving average together into

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,410
a ratio that makes a good
factor to use in state.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,585
Bollinger Band value is also good.

11
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,814
P/E ratio is good.

12
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:49,157
And a new kind of feature that we're
considering here with reinforcement

13
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:52,770
learning, is whether we're
holding the stock or not.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,470
That's an important state to know,
in other words,

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,460
if you're holding the stock it may
be advantageous to get rid of it.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,120
But if you're not holding it,
you might not necessarily want to sell.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,630
So this additional feature about
what your situation is is useful.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:17,020
Similarly, return since we entered
the position might be useful.

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,870
In other words,
this might help us set exit points for

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,990
instance, maybe we've made 10% on
the stock since we bought it and

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,270
we should take our
winnings while we can.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,980
So both of these are important and

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,140
good factors to have
an acute learning system.
