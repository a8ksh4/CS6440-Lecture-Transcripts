00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,752
Okay, assume now we've been watching our
interactions with the real world for

2
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:10,688
a while and
we would like to consult our model of T.

3
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:16,160
I would like for
you to write an expression for

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,970
T in terms of Tc or T count.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,137
Okay, so
fill in this text box with your opinion

6
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:31,346
of how we can compute T of s,
a, s prime in terms of T sub c.

7
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:36,950
And remember T sub c is just the number
of times each one of these has occurred.
