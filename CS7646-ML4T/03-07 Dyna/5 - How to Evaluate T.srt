1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,566
Okay, consider that state s and
a are somewhat fixed.

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:08,986
What we're trying to find is given s and
a,

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:13,870
what's the probability
of a particular s prime?

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,841
So, we'll begin this by just
consulting how many times

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,392
did this transition occur?

6
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:25,317
In other words, how many times when
we were in state s did action a,

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,390
did we end up in s'?

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,330
So that's how many times this
particular transition occurred.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,294
Now we just need to divide it by the
total number of times we were in state

10
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,649
s and did action a.

11
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:40,090
So essentially, it's the sum over i.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:46,520
Where we have i iterate over all
the possible states of T[s, a, i].

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,260
So this is the number of times in total

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,940
that we were in state s and
executed action a.

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,050
And so this ratio ends up being
the probability that will end up in s'

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,290
if we're in state s and take action a.
