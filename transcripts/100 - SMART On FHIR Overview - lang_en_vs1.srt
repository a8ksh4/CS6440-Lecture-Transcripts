1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
SMART development preceded FHIR,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,830
but as FHIR became more significant,

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,970
the project shifted to the development of a layer that

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,405
builds on the FHIR API and resource definitions.

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:14,790
As we explained earlier,

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,770
FHIR provides a set of core data models but many FHIR fields and value sets

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,630
may not be constrained to support

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,830
specific requirements across varied regions and use cases.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,265
To enable substitutable health apps as well as third party applications services,

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,590
SMART implies a set of profiles that provide developers with

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,300
expectations about the vocabularies they should use to represent medications,

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,660
problems, labs, and other clinical data.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,930
As part of the Argonaut Project we discussed earlier,

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,050
the five largest EHR vendors either have a will bill SMART into their products.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,560
The vendors, the SMART team,

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,275
and HL7 are working together to standardize the SMART API in HL7 specifications.

17
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:02,430
Clearly, third party apps must not access

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,305
protected health information without being registered into an EHR,

19
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:10,515
establishing trust in who is using those apps,

20
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,750
and respecting patient privacy choices.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,675
To facilitate this, SMART provides login and data access

22
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:23,085
authorization models based on the openID Connect and OAuth 2.0 standards.

23
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:26,970
In this lesson, we will look at how SMART uses these technologies.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,290
Through SMART Genomics and CDS Hooks,

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,920
the SMART Project is helping to find the next generation of FHIR base standards for

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,890
the clinical use of genomic data and the integration

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,665
of clinical decision support into provider workflows.

28
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,370
We will also discuss both of these efforts later.

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,850
To make it easier for developers to get started building apps,

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,191
the SMART Project offers a set of open source libraries for HTML5,

31
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:55,590
JavaScript, iOS, and Python.

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,670
To support running apps within the EHR's user interface,

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,050
SMART allows web apps to run inside browser widgets or inline frames.

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,680
It also supports native and mobile apps.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,560
SMART also offers a free web-based API Sandbox that developers can use to test

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,493
their apps as well as a locally installable version

37
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:20,065
the developers can download and run on their own system.

38
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:23,575
Here is the public Sandbox that everyone has access to,

39
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,405
but you can create your own.

40
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,040
Note that you can install your app and test it

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,430
using sample patients, practitioners, and data.

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,740
Here for example, is some of the extensive set of

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,195
vital signs data that is available for testing.

44
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:40,203
You can also create patient and practitioner personas

45
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,210
and use them in launch scenarios to test your app.

46
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,065
As illustrated here with a patient,

47
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,230
there are sample personas of both types

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,660
available for use if you do not need to build your own.

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,680
Note here that you can quickly see what type and

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,150
quantity of FHIR resources exist for each patient.

51
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,280
SMART offers FRED, a web-based interactive FHIR

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,090
resource editor to help developers create sample data for their apps.

53
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,950
I suggest you try using FRED to build a FHIR resource of your choice.

54
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,950
Here you see that I even put some elements of a FHIR patient resource representing me.

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,580
When I click Export JSON,

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,160
I get this JSON that corresponds to what I've input.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,510
SMART C3-PRO is a software library that integrates the SMART platform with research kit.

58
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,320
SMART's C3-PRO is a software library

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,745
that integrates the SMART platform with research kit.

60
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:41,070
Apple's open source framework to enable iOS apps to become tools for medical research.

61
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,565
Finally, the SMART site offers extensive documentation.

62
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,090
I strongly recommend you spend time there.
