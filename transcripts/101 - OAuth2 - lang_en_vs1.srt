00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
OAuth 2.0 Is a widely used authorization framework

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,765
that enables web and desktop applications,

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:10,500
as well as mobile devices to obtain specified

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,755
constrained access to user accounts on an HTTP service.

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:20,310
OAuth 2.0 defines four roles, resource owner,

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,345
resource server, authorization server which can be the same as the resource server,

7
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:30,065
client in our case the FHIR app.

8
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:33,510
The resource server host the protected information.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,150
The authorization server verifies the identity of the prospective user of

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,260
that information and then issues access tokens to the application.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,210
And OAuth 2.0 scope,

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,245
specifies the level of access such as read or write that the application is requesting.

13
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,345
In the case of SMART on FHIR,

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,650
the scope might specify what FHIR resources can be accessed for

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,570
a specified patient and how much of CRUD the app can perform on those resources.

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,970
In SMART on FHIR,

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,160
when a EHR user launches an app,

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,640
he gets a launch request notification,

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,553
the app asks for the permissions it needs using OAuth scopes such as patient/*.

20
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:23,655
read. In the case of a launch within an EHR charting session,

21
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:26,220
the scope patient/*.read refers to

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,190
the patient whose chart is in use at the time of the launch.

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,940
The term for this is in context and

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,540
this request only makes sense within a charting session.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,335
The app does not yet know who that patient is when it requests the scope,

26
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,720
it learns that from the access token response where

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,045
the patient property will provide the FHIR patient resource ID.

28
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:55,245
These so called launch parameters are an extremely important capability of SMART on FHIR.

29
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:58,850
As you know, tools such as clinical decision support have

30
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,280
existed for decades but have not found wide use.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,730
To coin a small pun,

32
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,000
providing this context literally allows the app to be smarter.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,390
Avoiding work for its clinical user and

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,050
thereby increasing the attractiveness of using the app.
