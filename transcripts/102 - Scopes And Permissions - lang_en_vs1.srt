1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,775
In the example we just discussed,

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:07,850
our hypothetical scope request contained a wildcard, the asterisk.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,115
Through it, a client app is seeking permission to obtain

4
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:18,495
all available and future fire resources stored on the server for the current patient.

5
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:21,770
This raises the issue of patient privacy.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,190
The authorization server asking a patient to authorize

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,650
a smart app requesting patient/*read,

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,480
should inform them that they are being asked to allow

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,150
the app access to all currently available and future

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,700
fire resources that might contain

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,310
potentially more sensitive data such as their genomic variations as we'll discuss later.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,445
Of course, as we discussed when we looked at health vault,

13
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:52,520
giving the patient usable tools to select what they are willing to share is a challenge.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,380
However, the granular nature of

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,855
fire resources could certainly facilitate the development of such a tool.

16
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:02,120
This would be particularly true if, as illustrated here,

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,475
in a medication request resource example from the fire site,

18
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:11,240
all applicable resources included the reason for orders and procedures.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,820
If they did, then a patient might specify that they wish to share all information

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,370
related to a particular clinical problem

21
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,835
and the app could figure out what that information is.

22
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,620
At present, these cause and

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,375
effect relationships are not in all the applicable fire resources.

24
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,085
Even if they were,

25
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,765
this is not just an issue for the standard.

26
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:38,390
A complete solution would require vendor support of the idea in

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,875
the AMR and provide a willingness to take the time to indicate these relationships.

28
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:48,230
Alternately, this may well be another opportunity for machine learning

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,070
to infer relationships from the data recorded over many patient encounters.

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,530
The authorization server may not grant the level of access requested by the app.

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,240
For example, an app with the goal of obtaining read and write access to

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,275
our old friend the patients allergy intolerance resources,

33
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,945
request the clinical scope of

34
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:14,240
patient/AllergyIntolerance.* The authorization server

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,065
may respond in a variety of ways as shown here.

36
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:21,485
App designers should anticipate this.

37
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,500
And their apps should consider the permissions granted to

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,570
them and they may need to change their behavior accordingly.
