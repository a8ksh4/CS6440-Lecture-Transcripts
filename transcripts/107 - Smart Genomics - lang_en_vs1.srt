00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Personalized or precision medicine is the concept of using

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,280
rich and potentially broad datasets about

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,635
an individual patient to guide optimal diagnosis and treatment decisions.

4
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:18,784
These datasets might supplement the traditional clinical record with behavioral,

5
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:23,535
environmental, socioeconomic and genomic information.

6
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:27,095
Behavioral data is largely the domain of MHealth,

7
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,990
a later topic in this course.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,779
Genomic datasets are very large.

9
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:36,285
Current estimates of a single patient's genome are around

10
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:42,370
3,200 megabytes or 3.2 times tenth of a ninth base pairs.

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,195
As a result, genomic data is unwieldy for direct use in patient care.

12
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:51,070
The goal of the SMART on FHIR genomics effort is to make

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,850
genomic data usable and useful in patient care.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,260
Among other things, it is defining

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,710
a new FHIR sequence resource that contains the most clinically relevant data,

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,925
as shown in part here.

17
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:10,920
It is also developing SMART apps that can present that data to clinicians in useful ways.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,115
Given the complexity of genomic data,

19
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,830
it should not be surprising that this is perhaps

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,660
the most complex FHIR resource yet specified.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,192
A specification includes instructions,

22
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,590
such as are shown here,

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,940
that explain how to document single nucleotide polymorphisms,

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,180
SNP or SNPs, the most common type of genetic variation among people.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,135
Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block called a nucleotide.

26
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:47,970
For example, here the nucleotide thymine or T in

27
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,600
the observed sequence replaces the nucleotide guanine or G in the reference sequence.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,379
Here you see how to document that substitution in the sequence resource.

29
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:03,750
Apps could access FHIR genomic resources from the HRs,

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,460
from genomic data repositories or specialized sequencing systems.

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,650
The key effort for a data provider is implementation of

32
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,340
a SMART on FHIR genomics data adapter which

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,580
creates a binding to convert between the standard SMART on

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,915
FHIR genomics format and the provider's native format.

35
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:27,185
KRAS is an oncogene that when mutated

36
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:31,655
has the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.

37
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,860
In this early example,

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,323
Vanderbilt School of Medicine's prototype SMART precision cancer medicine act

39
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:42,770
usefully presents genomic information in real time,

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,730
comparing a cancer patient's diagnosis specific detected

41
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,130
gene mutations to a comparable population of cancer patients.

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,040
It should be clear to you how the sequence resource we

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,630
just discussed would support an app such-
