1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,120
Yes. Ken Mandl, I direct a program at

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,750
Boston Children's Hospital called the Computational Health Informatics Program,

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:17,255
where we've got 23 faculty doing work in informatics across multiple dimensions.

4
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:18,790
One of those dimensions is SMART on FHIR.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:27,140
Well, at that moment,

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,170
the adoption of electronic health records was

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,040
only about five percent in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,355
There was about to be first a 19 billion but

9
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:42,530
then a $48 billion federal incentive program

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,970
and around promoting the adoption of electronic health records.

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,795
The opportunity we thought was then

12
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:55,475
to dictate what the requirements of that program might be.

13
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,220
And we suggested that the requirements could be

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,770
reduced to really one very simple principle,

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,373
which is that the electronic medical records should be able to behave like iPhones,

16
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:10,295
and that they should be able to run apps,

17
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,070
and that those apps should be able to be added

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,800
to or deleted from the electronic medical record.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,230
We call that the principle of substitutability and argued that

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:27,590
substitutability should be the driving force behind interoperability.

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,455
The opportunity was designed to produce a few important effects.

22
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:40,010
One was so that innovators could readily get their innovations to

23
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,025
the point of care in the same way that

24
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,755
app developers for the iPhone platform were able to do that.

25
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,490
It separated the innovators from

26
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,490
the electronic medical record companies and that

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,397
our vision of substitutability was that it would also be vendor independence.

28
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,970
So the app developer wouldn't even need

29
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,120
to know which electronic health record it was going to run on.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,756
Now, the iPhone was only one year old at the time.

31
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,740
And when we wrote the article,

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,785
there were 10,000 apps developed for the iPhone.

33
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:12,110
When it was published three months later,

34
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,673
there were 50,000 apps in the iTunes App Store.

35
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:20,400
And so we caught this phenomenon at a hockey sticking moment,

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,100
and the world was just starting also to understand why

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,900
the iPod that they had now needed to make phone calls or,

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,545
alternatively, why their telephone needed to play music.

39
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,080
And people were starting to understand this App Store was actually

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,690
a really important part of this new technology.

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,157
So one is innovator to the point of care.

42
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:49,220
The other is end users so that they can actually select from

43
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,025
a market of applications as opposed to only what comes out of the box,

44
00:02:55,025 --> 00:03:02,540
such as the end users can enjoy a truly competitive market to

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,170
produce the functionality that they want and to enable them to

46
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,850
customize that functionality if they want to produce apps within their organizations.

47
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,875
Yes. It's really, I think, a very happy story.

48
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:26,845
We began with a restful model of call-in resources across

49
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,830
an API and with

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,360
well-defined resources that represent only a subset of all possible types of health data,

51
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,890
the most useful subset to get started with.

52
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,433
And we used an RDF technology initially to define those resources,

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,645
and we were actually getting apps developed and developing our own apps.

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:56,575
But we started to see this very interesting FHIR community cohering.

55
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,425
And not only did we think it was interesting,

56
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:05,050
but we jumped in and decided to actually help create the FHIR standard and

57
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:11,285
to really promote it and to get behind the founders of FHIR.

58
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:15,430
Another nice aspect of it for SMART is that wall SMART

59
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,285
was attempting to define a universal standard for an API.

60
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:27,485
The SMART team had no aspirations to become a standards body.

61
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:32,350
So the fact that SMART had been ingested into HL7,

62
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,918
and that HL7 was going to not only further develop the standard

63
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:41,223
but also make it freely available was extremely attractive.

64
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:46,705
And it became very clear that one way that SMART could have longevity and

65
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:55,900
scale would be to rely on a standards body for the standards part of the project.

66
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,905
On the whole, the products on the market are

67
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:11,280
older software stacks that are monolithically designed and many of them are pre-Internet.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,335
Now, they are, of course,

69
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:18,980
being updated all the time but the degree to which

70
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,790
the developers in the EMR companies could be truly nimble about

71
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,575
evolving the products and somewhat limited by their complexity.

72
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:33,110
So what SMART enables the ecosystem to produce

73
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,250
is essentially a facade that interoperates with the electronic medical record,

74
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,435
leaving it fully in place,

75
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:48,470
keep taking advantage of all its myriad capabilities but providing for

76
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:56,300
the clinician or for the patient a modern web-based user interface.

77
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,045
So what SMART does very specifically is it brings the full capabilities

78
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:08,325
of the worldwide web to the point of care connected to the electronic medical record.

79
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,535
So, now, you can do anything you can do on the web and

80
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:17,135
HTML5 with data mashups, data visualizations,

81
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:20,043
bringing in external data sources,

82
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:24,455
genomics for example or environmental data,

83
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:33,590
and do it in the context of the physician workflow.

84
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,285
It's a very good question.

85
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:41,550
SMART on FHIR apps can begin to play a role in bringing evidence to the point of care.

86
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,030
First of all, I think we're in a transition where we believe

87
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:56,185
that evidence comes from data at least as much as it comes from the medical literature.

88
00:06:56,185 --> 00:07:00,630
So one way that evidence-based medicine has been

89
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,260
interpreted is the best use of the medical literature as applied to one's patient.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,860
So SMART on FHIR can help with that aspect of

91
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,485
a traditionally defined evidence-based medicine

92
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:17,400
through its connections into decision support through

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,025
this CDS Hooks process or other ways to bring in guidelines

94
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:30,345
and interpreted medical literature into the decision making process of the physician.

95
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,845
But the other aspect that I think is more exciting even is

96
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:39,405
that decisions will be made on the basis of

97
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:45,540
insights that have been derived through advanced modeling and

98
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:53,130
deep learning or even derived on the fly from very large population data sets.

99
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,329
Interestingly, those data sets are created in part through electronic medical records,

100
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,388
collecting data from every visit.

101
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:10,575
But, also, data is important from other sources: social media, public health genomics.

102
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:17,380
And all of those forms of data can provide a new kind of evidence-based medicine,

103
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,215
a really data-driven form of evidence-based care.

104
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:26,190
And through the power of simply taking advantage

105
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,930
of all the innovations that have happened in the web

106
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,920
and the opportunity to bring data sources together to

107
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,990
have different computational processes interacting with each other,

108
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,976
to provide advanced data visualization,

109
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:46,290
we can begin to bring this new form of data

110
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,820
driven evidence right into the physician's workflow.

111
00:08:53,270 --> 00:09:01,510
Absolutely. So SMART on FHIR actually is a project that

112
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,260
builds upon work we did around a patient-controlled health record,

113
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,170
in which there is a repository of data that

114
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,990
the patient controls with apps running on top.

115
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,370
The problem with patient-controlled health records in the past has been that they

116
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,480
haven't been easily fed by data from electronic medical records in other systems.

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,420
The data hasn't been interoperable.

118
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,870
So, patients haven't been empowered with their data and they

119
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,805
certainly haven't been empowered with apps running on their data.

120
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:38,920
Instead, what patients got over the last decade or so

121
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,240
was portals that are bolt ons to the electronic medical record.

122
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,140
And so those portals give patients a view into the electronic medical record data.

123
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,825
Generally, they don't take the data out with them,

124
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,485
but at least, they can see it.

125
00:09:55,485 --> 00:10:01,370
The portals, therefore, have had somewhat limited functionality.

126
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:08,890
The opportunity now that's SMART on FHIR brings to the patient is two-fold.

127
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:15,170
One, it lets the patient actually take out their data and get a copy of it.

128
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,940
The right to do that is reinforced by what's called meaningful use stage three.

129
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,660
And it's also reinforced by now the 21st Century Cures Act, which is law.

130
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,190
So, the patient can get a copy of their data.

131
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,200
And secondly, the patient can connect apps just like

132
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,520
the provider apps to an electronic medical records system,

133
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,355
so that they can enjoy the same kinds of benefits, data visualization,

134
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:49,465
data mashups, computational processes,

135
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,280
serving their healthcare needs.

136
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:59,165
Well, it's very interesting.

137
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:08,070
There's an absolutely exploding field around data generated by sensors,

138
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,729
data generated by standard mobile devices, iPhones and androids,

139
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:23,190
and data developed by the same technologies and various wearable forms.

140
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,250
The ability to ingest those data into

141
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,540
the electronic medical record is one important area.

142
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,205
Electronic medical records are not particularly designed to do this,

143
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:39,415
so one intermediate layer where the data from the electronic medical record

144
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:44,350
and from this new generation of sensor technologies,

145
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,295
is in this SMART on FHIR layer.

146
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:51,550
On top of the electronic medical record,

147
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,230
it also provides a real opportunity to

148
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:03,475
deliver the right interpreted information from these sensors to the clinician.

149
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:07,150
Most clinicians will not be interested in raw data.

150
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,965
And so, the question that everyone's asking is,

151
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,530
"What's the best set of workflows to get those data

152
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,000
into a decision making process with the physician and the patient?"

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,350
I think SMART on FHIR apps provide at least an early solution to addressing that issue.

154
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,810
Well, I think one

155
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,430
of the most exciting opportunities to interface public health to the point of care,

156
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,290
is the tremendous population and representative

157
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,990
population data resources that public health has that can

158
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,330
form the decision making for an individual patient.

159
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,425
A patient's diagnosis, or laboratory data,

160
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:59,310
or symptoms, not in an epidemiological context,

161
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,937
is much less useful.

162
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,455
So for example, if a patient has a sore throat,

163
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:07,095
and we're trying to decide whether to test them for Strep,

164
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:11,610
there is a much higher chance that that test will be

165
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,760
positive if there is Strep going around in that person's area.

166
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,360
That could be readily derived from a population health,

167
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,070
or public health dataset.

168
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,320
That could guide our testing,

169
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,860
and rational testing, and treatment around Strep throat.

170
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,635
Reduction of false positives could save

171
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:35,820
literally hundreds of thousands of courses of antibiotics per year.

172
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,130
That's one example of how population data can inform individual care.

173
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:53,775
So it's a very nice research-related use of the SMART API,

174
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:58,590
such that a participant in the precision medicine initiative,

175
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,770
now known as the All of Us Initiative,

176
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,170
can request a copy of their data from their local health system by connecting

177
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:13,448
an app to the Smart API at that health system,

178
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:17,555
and direct a copy of those data to

179
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:22,310
go to the Precision Medicine Initiative or the All of Us Initiative.

180
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,500
It's essentially a way that operational liases data donation for research subjects in

181
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:38,795
a very large study seeking to recruit a million patients.

182
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,290
So, I think at the moment,

183
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,375
we have an incredible opportunity with SMART,

184
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,341
because it's been built into the electronic medical record products.

185
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:52,045
It's essentially been regulated that there be these APIs.

186
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,885
And even beyond regulated,

187
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,450
it's made it into the law.

188
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,480
So we're moving into a more modern era of

189
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,200
interaction and interoperability between medical systems.

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:10,565
Where I think we need a lot of emphasis now is to create a robust apps ecosystem,

191
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:15,335
and we need to focus on a few key areas to do that.

192
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:19,970
One is we need to make it much easier to develop apps.

193
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,565
I have a lot of folks come to me with great ideas.

194
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:30,865
But the recommendation is always, get some funding,

195
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,200
find an app developer,

196
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,130
try to develop an app with that developer,

197
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,195
and then figure out how to maintain it.

198
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:41,410
We need to be able to make app development into

199
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:49,355
a much more commodity process so that good ideas are very rapidly translated.

200
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:55,735
We also need to increase the level of expectation that scientific findings,

201
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,900
particularly around those that

202
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,355
are designed to have an impact on the medical care process,

203
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:07,795
are computable and can be operationalized.

204
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:14,125
So I would really like to see publications that are developing algorithms,

205
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,740
have accompanying apps with them that can be

206
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,210
plugged into and tested in the health care system right away.

207
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,000
All right. Thank you, Mark. Very pleased to be here.
