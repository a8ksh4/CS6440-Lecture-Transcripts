1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
With Josh Mandel.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,470
Josh, can you introduce yourself briefly?

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,700
Sure. So I'm Josh Mandel.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,265
I'm a physician and a software developer.

5
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,470
And since I graduated from medical school,

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,655
I've been working on various projects in healthcare informatics with the goal of

7
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,100
making it easier for developers to build

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,760
new functionality that integrates into the healthcare system.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,860
Sure.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,930
So when the history goes back for me to about 2010,

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,015
I was graduating from medical school,

12
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,170
and as a medical student,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,320
I had been very interested in making the computers do

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,650
more for me and for my classmates and for clinicians and patients.

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,450
And I had learned about this field of medical informatics.

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,720
So on my way out of medical school,

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,510
I was really excited to join a team that was just coming

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,620
together at Harvard Medical School on this new research project called SMART,

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,630
which was funded by a grant from

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,507
the federal government with the goal of building an app platform,

21
00:00:57,507 --> 00:01:01,800
so building a way for developers to connect to the data inside of healthcare systems,

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,160
and present apps that doctors and other clinicians and patients could

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,045
use to make sense of the data and the medical records.

24
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,820
And when we started this project in 2010,

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,770
we really started from scratch.

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,170
We said, "What would a modern REST API look like for working with healthcare data?

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,705
What are the kinds of data we care about?"

28
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,220
And we made a list: medications,

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,390
problems at labs and allergies and so forth.

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,920
And we started asking, "Okay.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,495
Well, what are the detailed data models?

32
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:28,710
What are the attributes of each of

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,110
these data types that we'd want to be able to work with?"

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,950
And, early on, we hosted some sample data that we put together,

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,105
working with a number of partners.

36
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:37,935
We integrated into a couple of

37
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:40,080
open source electronic health records systems to

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,480
give developers a picture of what this would look like,

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,285
and we held a competition asking for folks to build apps and share their ideas.

40
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:48,855
And we got great feedback from the developer community saying,

41
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,879
"We wish we had this kind of interface in the real world,

42
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,000
inside of real healthcare systems."

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
At the same time, when we had conversations with some of the health IT vendors that make

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,720
big electronic health records that are in production at some

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,014
of the major hospitals and health care centers,

46
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,803
the feedback that we got was,

47
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:07,140
"We're really excited about this technology,

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,780
but we're not going to go and implement a whole new set of

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,015
capabilities just to align with this research project at Harvard.

50
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:16,590
What we really need is a set of standards that we can agree on as

51
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,595
an industry to support these apps but also to support other use cases as well."

52
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:24,615
So that was about when I started getting involved in the standards development process,

53
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:29,520
and got involved with the development of what was then the very early days of FHIR,

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,332
the vast healthcare interoperability resources standard.

55
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,380
Sure.

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,420
So, early in the project,

57
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,530
we discussed a number of ways to improve access for developers to clinical data.

58
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,475
And we settled on a relatively small scope to begin with,

59
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,620
which was focused on building apps that could integrate with EHR and

60
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,178
mostly have access to read data from inside of the systems.

61
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,590
So data liberation, exposing what was in

62
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,020
those EHR systems and making sure that apps

63
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,845
could take advantage of those data and present a user interface.

64
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:09,805
And we were able to make a lot of progress by keeping the scope pretty narrow.

65
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,260
So the kinds of things that were left out of scope from the beginning

66
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,220
were being able to write complex data back into the EHR,

67
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,310
being able to integrate deeply with a clinical workflow

68
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,500
by restricting where and when an app gets presented.

69
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,980
We left out of scope

70
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,185
how multiple apps might run at the same time and

71
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,770
interact with one another through sort of real-time communications.

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,210
We left that all out of scope and said,

73
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,270
"Can we just solve the problem of putting one app at a time inside

74
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,360
of one EHR at a time with a consistent interface?"

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,690
And the exciting thing is because we were able to keep the scope pretty narrow,

76
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,765
we really focused on things that could be done without a lot of new research efforts,

77
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:49,115
things that could be built into the production systems in the real world.

78
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:52,070
We started to see uptake of this technology from some of

79
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,600
the biggest health technology vendors so that

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,890
now if you go to the healthcare trade show

81
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,690
and you look at some of the big vendor systems,

82
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,510
they are announcing support for and now they have support rolled out in production for

83
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,660
these capabilities inside of their health records that clinicians

84
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,255
use and also inside of their patient portals that patients use.

85
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:15,110
So we're really starting to see it become a reality for

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,260
these apps to get access to data and to be able

87
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,440
to display innovative user interfaces and make

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,010
recommendations for clinicians and for patients as well.

89
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,075
So we're at the point right now where our narrow scope has become a reality,

90
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:31,640
and it's very exciting to think about what comes next,

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,950
how we can begin to tackle some of those issues that we

92
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,410
left farther on the development queue.

93
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:43,580
Yeah, so one of

94
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,190
the great things about having a way to integrate apps with

95
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,890
the EHR is that apps can do practically anything,

96
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,540
anything you set your mind to and anything you can

97
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,770
display inside a window for a user to see.

98
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,180
But one of the challenges with apps is that you

99
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,940
have to know which app to run and when to run it.

100
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,320
And so, for example, if we have an application that helps clinicians make sense of

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,907
the bilirubin levels in a newborn infant and provide decision guidance,

102
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,845
such a child who needs phototherapy or other therapy or this level's normal.

103
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,045
If a clinician doesn't think to run the app,

104
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,070
they're not going to benefit from the advice.

105
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,160
So one of the big problems that we set out to solve was how

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,900
to recommend exactly the right app to the right user at the right time,

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,910
and even to look at kinds of integration

108
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,850
that might be a little bit less than launching a whole app,

109
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,080
but just integrating a snippet of advice or recommendations into the clinical workflow.

110
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,970
So the CDS Hooks project is really about that.

111
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,800
It's about watching what a clinician does while they're working with

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,135
the electronic health records system all day long and instrumenting that interaction,

113
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,250
looking for specific points in the interaction,

114
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,140
like opening a new patient chart or prescribing any medication or reviewing a set

115
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,730
of orders or lab tests that a clinician might be about to order.

116
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,560
We look for the specific points in the workflow, and we say,

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,230
"We're going to provide a way for external services to

118
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,041
offer their advice inline at those points."

119
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:10,295
And the advice could be as simple as a little bit of text for the user to read,

120
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:15,335
or it could be as rich as a link for them to click to launch a SMART app from

121
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,580
right inside the context of

122
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,650
their electronic health records system and really do a much more detailed workflow,

123
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:27,256
where they can provide some more inputs and get some advice that they can act on.

124
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:31,430
Sure.

125
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,810
So the Sync for Science initiative,

126
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,285
Sync for Science is a project that is focused on specific use case.

127
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,820
It says, "How can we help patients who

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,500
might want to share their medical records with researchers?"

129
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,935
Because the truth is that if you're doing a research study,

130
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,295
it's very easy to ask questions to your research participants.

131
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:52,720
You can create a form and collect structured data by asking.

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,790
But there's a rich history in the medical record that can be

133
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,417
very hard to obtain in a structured way.

134
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,220
It can be hard to obtain quickly or

135
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,545
automatically and without a lot of barriers in the way.

136
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,650
So, today, oftentimes, the way that a researcher

137
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,855
might get access to a medical record would be

138
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:11,690
either on paper by asking for

139
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,930
a medical record request and getting a stack of paper printed out,

140
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,190
or they might work with a hospital to develop a custom technology.

141
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,430
They might have to sit down and write special queries against

142
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,385
the raw database and try to pull out the fields they care about.

143
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:28,250
And both of those things are very slow and very expensive.

144
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,555
So in the Sync for Science project,

145
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,245
we've said, "How can we automate this?

146
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,710
How can we help patients share their data with researchers

147
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,585
in a way that gives full control to the patients,

148
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:37,965
but when a patient wants to,

149
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:41,105
they can automatically approve that kind of access?"

150
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,690
And it's a project that we've been running through Harvard Medical School.

151
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,030
There's a small technical team that's been helping to

152
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,998
develop a specification and some guidelines,

153
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:54,105
but we've been working very closely with the electronic health record community.

154
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:58,490
So we've been working with Epic and Cerner and Allscripts and eClinicalWorks,

155
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,000
working with each of these vendors to make sure they can build this technology into

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,690
their own patient portal products so that if I am

157
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,115
a patient at a hospital or clinic that uses a patient portal from one of those vendors,

158
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:14,000
I have a consistent way that I can approve an app to access my data.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,410
And the cool thing is that under the hood,

160
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,215
we're using all those same standards that we've been talking about.

161
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:21,680
We're using the SMART on FHIR API to do that approval process.

162
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,990
There's an OAuth workflow using a standard set of

163
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,125
specifications to let a patient give access when they want to.

164
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,860
And then we're using the FHIR resource definitions

165
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,590
to be able to fetch specific kinds of data

166
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,320
like medications or allergy lists or lab results or immunizations and on down the list.

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,635
So it's been a really exciting project to see this technology

168
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:46,910
go from a set of use cases on paper or on our website

169
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,140
to now being implemented inside of patient portals from some of

170
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,360
the biggest electronic health record vendors in the country.

171
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,445
It's been a very interesting course for me over the last seven years,

172
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,485
which is to say, when I started,

173
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:08,720
I was pretty naive about the pace of progress and

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,000
I thought that things might move faster.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,063
And the longer that I stayed involved,

176
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,440
and the more that I saw what it took to

177
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,205
really enable change inside of these organizations,

178
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,080
the more I've been surprised in

179
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,970
a positive way by how much we've been able to achieve in this time.

180
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,235
So the biggest leap that I saw us make was from talking about

181
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,866
this work as a research project as a cool idea about what the future could look like.

182
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,550
And if I go back and I look at the slides that I was presenting in 2010, 2011,

183
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,710
2012, they were really focused on this technology as a vision for the future,

184
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,615
but not as a reality.

185
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:49,310
And then if I look at what started to happen, 2013, 2014, 2015,

186
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,168
vendors started picking up this technology and saying,

187
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:55,515
"We can use this to solve real problems that our customers are asking for.

188
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:59,420
We can use this to extend the features that are electronic health records systems

189
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,040
have by really taking advantage of the wide market of app developers,

190
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,890
who have good ideas about how to work with clinical data."

191
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,095
So I would say that from where I sit right now,

192
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:11,030
I've been really positively surprised by

193
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,200
how quickly we've been able to make this progress.

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,510
And I think that a major factor in our progress has been keeping

195
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,160
the scope small enough to feel like it's not too far over the edge.

196
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,820
And so I'm talking to you right now from San Diego at

197
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,115
the end of a working group meeting

198
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:31,260
of the standards development organization, Health Level-7.

199
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,540
We've been here for a week,

200
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,393
working with folks across the world,

201
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:37,400
who are helping to define some of these health care standards.

202
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,960
And one of the big challenges working with a group like this is everyone is

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,325
really passionate and has

204
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:47,165
huge aspirations about what they'd like to accomplish in this space.

205
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:50,300
But there's always a very careful balancing act between what you would like to

206
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,945
see happen and what you can really make happen in a short time frame.

207
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,500
And I think a big factor in our success has been focusing on the sort

208
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,277
of short to medium term.

209
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:07,030
So predictions are so challenging.

210
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,874
When I think about the kinds of work that we've been doing,

211
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,560
it's been focused a lot on workflow.

212
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
It's been focused a lot on how do we put

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,495
the right app in front of the right user at the right time.

214
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:19,995
And I think that's incredibly important in today's install base,

215
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,420
where there's a certain way that EHRs look and feel,

216
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,845
and they have certain capabilities built in.

217
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:28,420
But, honestly, it's unrealistic to expect the base product to develop

218
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,475
these neat new sophisticated features in every possible direction.

219
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:36,385
So being able to open up that window and launch an app is really important.

220
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,668
I don't know if I'll predict,

221
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:40,105
but I'll say that I hope in 10 years,

222
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,400
this whole paradigm may be turned on its head,

223
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,235
which is to say, we won't necessarily be working with EHRs that look

224
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:48,320
and feel the way that today's systems do.

225
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
We may have very tailored systems that are focused

226
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,435
on the particular tasks that our user is trying to do,

227
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:56,235
and rather than launching an app from inside a system like that,

228
00:11:56,235 --> 00:12:01,010
I think that the data will begin to become more of the central focus of the platform.

229
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,415
We're almost seeing an inversion of the control

230
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,995
so that rather than the EHR being the central focus,

231
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,825
the data will become the central focus,

232
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:11,800
and we'll be able to construct the kinds of workflows we need around those data.

233
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,645
That's a really abstract concept,

234
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,075
but to draw that home maybe a little bit better,

235
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,340
I would say that I hope in that time frame,

236
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,520
what we'll have is individual systems that

237
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,663
know how to take care of patients with specific diseases, for example,

238
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,250
and provide a really tailored workflow and experience for making

239
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,010
the right choices and incorporating patient preferences and

240
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:36,154
feedback from patients into that kind of workflow.

241
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure.
