1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
Earlier we said that while the U.S. excels in high technology care,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,175
our overall health care quality,

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:10,585
efficiency, and safety results are poor.

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:16,300
In large part, this is because most health care costs are due to the incurable,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,290
lifelong chronic diseases that our health care system is not designed to treat.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,755
Patients with multiple chronic diseases account disproportionately for those costs.

7
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:31,860
Here's the opening paragraph of

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,580
a 2004 paper in public health reports that I strongly recommend you read.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,085
Quote: In 2000, approximately 125 million Americans,

10
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,645
45% of the population,

11
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:52,063
had chronic conditions, and 61 million,

12
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:54,245
21% of the population,

13
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:57,415
had multiple chronic conditions.

14
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:59,820
The number of people with chronic conditions is

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,980
projected to increase steadily over the next 30 years.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,350
While current health care financing and

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,825
delivery systems were designed primarily to treat acute conditions,

18
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:16,340
78% of health spending is devoted to people with chronic conditions.

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,770
Quality medical care for people with

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,790
chronic conditions requires a new orientation toward prevention of

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,370
chronic disease and provision of

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,345
ongoing care in care management to maintain their health status and functioning.

23
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:37,090
Specific focus should be applied to people with multiple chronic conditions. End quote.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,350
The paper then goes on to describe the care of those patients saying, quote,

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,310
while the average Medicare beneficiary sees between six and seven different physicians,

26
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,100
beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,135
see almost 14 different physicians in a year,

28
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:01,205
an average 37 physician visits annually.

29
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:06,730
People with five or more chronic conditions fill almost 50 prescriptions in a year.

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,015
This stunning fragmentation of the care of the people who drive

31
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:16,550
most health care costs is the central rationale for interoperability.

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,780
This is so key that I'll now interview one of the authors of

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,320
that paper Dr. Jared Anderson of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins.
