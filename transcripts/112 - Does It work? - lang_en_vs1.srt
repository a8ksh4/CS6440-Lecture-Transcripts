1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,850
Does AM Health actually improve outcomes or lower costs?

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,675
A 2015 article, in the Journal of Medical Internet Research,

3
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:15,280
focused on AM Health as a tool to increase adherence in crying disease management.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,140
The authors found 107 papers that met their criteria.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,230
Of these, 41 more randomized clinical trials that measured the effects of

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,640
AM Health on disease specific clinical outcomes in conditions such as diabetes,

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,875
or chronic cardiovascular, or lung diseases.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,580
16 of these studies,

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,460
around 40% reported significant improvements.

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,420
Based on this, the authors say quote,

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,920
"There is potential for AM Health tools to better

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,930
facilitate adherence to chronic disease management,

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,050
but the evidence supporting its current effectiveness is mixed."

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,290
You can see here,

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,260
in this graphic from that article that text messaging,

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,450
SMS, was the most commonly used tool in the primary platform.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,840
It can facilitate patient provider communication,

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,145
medication reminders, and data collection and exchange,

19
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:11,785
on disease specific measurements.

20
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:16,455
As well as deliver patient education and motivation.

21
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:20,635
It has the advantage you're working on virtually all cell phones.

22
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,465
This can be particularly important in developing countries where

23
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:27,130
lower cost phones may be more common.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,430
The next most common technology with smartphone apps,

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,913
often use to help diabetes patients remember to check symptoms,

26
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,490
maintain a food diary,

27
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,280
or connect to educators in real-time.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,690
Next, where standalone wireless or Bluetooth compatible devices are those such as

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,170
a blood glucose meter that are connected to a phone for

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,475
automatic transfer of data for review by a healthcare provider.

31
00:01:54,475 --> 00:02:00,260
In some systems, measurements that fall outside of the target range, trigger alerts.

32
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,085
Another issue is AM Health data quality.

33
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,990
A study in December,

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,370
2016 issue of the respected journal Health Affairs,

35
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:16,660
evaluated 137 patient facing AM Health apps that were highly rated by consumers,

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,045
and recommended by experts,

37
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:21,040
and that targeted high-need,

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,340
high-cost populations based on a long list of medical conditions.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,360
The authors found that quote,

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,595
"Consumers ratings were poor indications of apps clinical utility or usability,

41
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,820
and that most apps did not respond appropriately

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,875
when a user entered potentially dangerous health information."

43
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,970
End quote. They further found that, quote,

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,900
"very few apps focused on providing guidance based on

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,565
user entered information or support through social networks,

46
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:54,130
or on rewarding behavior change.

47
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,440
Functionality is likely to be useful to relatively more engaged patients."

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,185
The authors also note that quote,

49
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:05,410
"data privacy and security will continue to be

50
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,220
major concerns in the dissemination of AM Health apps."

51
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,060
End quote. This is an interesting,

52
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,595
but unfortunately not yet openly available study.

53
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,290
Another aspect of AM Health data quality is

54
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,340
the ability of patients to properly operate in-home devices.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,645
They may incorrectly wear blood pressure cuffs.

56
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,930
Patients may hold an item,

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,125
steadying themselves against a wall or other object,

58
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:36,325
or wear substantially different clothing as they weigh themselves.

59
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:40,538
These issues clearly point to the need for careful training,

60
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:43,245
and devices that to the extent possible,

61
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:48,000
can detect such situations and coax patients to use proper technique.
