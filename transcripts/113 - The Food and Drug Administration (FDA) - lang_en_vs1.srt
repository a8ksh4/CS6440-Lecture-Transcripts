1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Here in the U.S, The Food and Drug Administration or FDA,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,830
is responsible for regulating medical devices.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,885
The details are complex,

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,710
but the level of FDA oversight generally increases with

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,657
the perceived patient risk presented by the device.

6
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:23,895
Devices that perform the same function ha already approved predicate devices,

7
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:28,748
and do not introduce new risks or generally subject to minimal regulations.

8
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,270
Novel devices must go through a far more complex,

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,683
expensive, and time consuming process.

10
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:38,020
What about medical apps?

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,543
Given finite resources and the scale of app development,

12
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,100
it was clear that the FDA had to draw a line

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,290
to determine which apps it would even consider.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,230
In February 2015, the agency announced plans

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,449
to only review mobile medical apps that interpret data,

16
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,130
and act like medical devices.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,640
The agency says it will only regulate apps that present

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,705
a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended,

19
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:10,560
or that cause smartphones or other mobile platforms to have

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,437
impact on the functionality or performance of traditional medical devices.

21
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:21,850
More specifically, the agency does not intend to regulate apps that help patients

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,730
self-manage their disease or condition without providing specific treatment suggestions.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,250
Provide patients with simple tools to organize and track their health information.

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,870
Provide easy access and information related to health conditions or treatments.

25
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,480
Help patients document, show or

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,515
communicate potential medical conditions to health care providers.

27
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:48,010
Automate simple tasks for health care providers,

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,860
or enable patients or providers interact with

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,935
personal health records or electronic health record systems.

30
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:58,060
The FDA will also not oversee

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,505
the mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets which can run medical apps.

32
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:04,891
To a large degree,

33
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,590
this decision leaves quality control in the hands of app developers,

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,000
providers, and their patients.
