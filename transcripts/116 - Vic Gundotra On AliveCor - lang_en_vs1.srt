00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
AliveCor got started because of the invention

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,825
of a really brilliant doctor, Dr. Dave Albert.

3
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:11,105
His latest invention was a small device that is about the size of a stick of gum.

4
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:13,530
And this extraordinary device works with

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,895
your smartphone and allows you to analyze the EKG of your heart,

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:22,985
not a heart rate, not like you might get with a Fitbit or with a sports watch.

7
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:26,940
But the actual electrical rhythm of your heart which

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,020
is incredibly important to diagnose some of the more serious heart conditions.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,390
Most people don't realize that heart disease is

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,025
the number one killer of men and women worldwide.

11
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:41,395
In fact, last year about 18 million people died from heart disease.

12
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,235
What's next for AliveCor is probably the most exciting part.

13
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:49,260
We are working on some extraordinary technologies using deep learning,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,390
artificial intelligence that analyze the morphology of your personal EKG,

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,275
your heart, and detect things that previously were not available to human eyes.

16
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:03,960
The machines can see things about your health that were previously

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,040
undiscovered whether that be potassium levels or other measures of physiology.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,170
We're just getting started on unlocking the secrets of your heart.
