1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,115
Unsurprisingly, interoperability of medical devices is a challenge,

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,135
both within and outside of hospitals.

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:13,050
A 2012, Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,905
AAMI survey of 1,900 US hospitals,

5
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,890
found that interoperability issues were first and

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,205
second on the list of medical device challenges.

7
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27,180
Specifically, they were integrating

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,785
medical devices and systems into the hospital's network,

9
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:34,336
which was cited by 72% of respondents.,

10
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:37,590
and integrating device data into EHRs,

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,590
which was cited by 65% of respondents.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,250
When we looked at Health For you saw a plethora of devices used by patients,

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,240
each of them typically has its own proprietary data formats.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,370
So Health For provided value by bringing that data together in one record,

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,440
along with other data collected from EHRs or documented by the patient.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,100
In the past the vice data was often available only

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,353
via a portal maintained by its manufacturer.

18
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,925
And there might have been a charge to use it.

19
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:15,475
Continua Health Alliance founded in 2006,

20
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,480
is an international non-profit open industry group

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,570
of nearly 240 healthcare organizations and vendors.

22
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,336
Its goal is to establish mHealth interoperability in three major categories,

23
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:33,375
chronic disease management, aging independently,

24
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,820
and health and physical fitness.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,660
Personal Connected Health Alliance is a non-profit organization

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,300
formed by the huge Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society HIMSS,

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,520
Continua, and the mHealth summit to bring together stakeholders to quote

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,577
realize the full potential of personal connected health end quote.

29
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:59,620
It now publishes and promotes the global adoption of

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,975
continuous open mHealth interoperability framework.

31
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:08,290
Human API and Validic are two interesting companies that have each developed

32
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,800
an interoperability platform for mHealth data from a wide variety of sources,

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,855
aimed at both patient care and wellness.

34
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:22,925
Both offer rest APIs to access their normalized data in JSON formats.

35
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:27,250
I have posted links to their sites where you can see how this works.

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,772
Note, that the results may come back in a JSON format,

37
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:34,000
but not yet in an industry standard format.
