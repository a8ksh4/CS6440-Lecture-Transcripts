1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Earlier, I mentioned that in addition to its schemas,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,960
OpenAM Health provides useful tools.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,855
One of these might be of particular interest to students of this course.

4
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:15,750
It allows users to specify a dataset they want generated using YAML,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,780
a data serialization language designed to be

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,380
both human-readable and computationally powerful.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,925
This example asks for body weights over

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:30,780
a particular date range and with specified starting and end values,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,470
standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,290
OpenAM Health also provides a library of

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,740
visualization tools to use once the data is generated.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,270
This example, plots both minutes of physical activity

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,380
and step counts and is scrollable to vary the time period covered.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,890
Earlier, I mentioned Human API and Validic,

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,630
two companies that offer

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,355
their own proprietary platforms for integrating AM health data from multiple sources.

17
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:03,230
OpenAM Health has developed Shimmer,

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,140
an open source tool to pull health data from popular third-party APIs,

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,185
like Runkeeper and Fitbit,

20
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:13,580
and convert it into an OpenAM Health-compliant format.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,150
The tool is of obvious benefit to app developers since,

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,495
somewhat similarly to FHIR,

23
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:25,080
it allows them to develop independently of the underlying data source.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,820
Currently, the number of data sources is small compared to the commercial platforms,

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,875
but OpenAM Health says it is working to add more.

26
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:40,510
It also offers Pulse to map HL7 messages from EHRs into OpenAM Health's schema.
