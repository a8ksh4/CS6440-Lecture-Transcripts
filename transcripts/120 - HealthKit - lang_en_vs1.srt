Apple's HealthKit demonstrates the growing importance of AM Health.

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:09,330
HealthKit stores data from iPhone and Apple Watch apps and from

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,310
some devices in an encrypted database called the HealthKit store.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,105
The data is only accessible via the health app,

5
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,845
through which users can view, add, delete,

6
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:23,830
and otherwise manage all of their health and fitness data.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,325
Importantly, as shown here,

8
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:31,350
they can control fine grained permissions for the sharing of each data type.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,145
Users must explicitly grant each app permission

10
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:39,380
to read from and write data to the HealthKit store.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,720
Users can grant or deny permission separately for each type of data.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,260
For example, a user can allow an app to read their step count,

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,640
but prevent it from reading their blood glucose level.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,904
To prevent possible information leaks,

15
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:59,130
an app does not know about denials and from the app's point of view,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,060
data for which it lacks read permission does not exist.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,500
Once an app has been granted permission to access data in the store,

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,325
it can use OpenAM Health's Granola tool to store it on a remote server for analysis or

19
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,260
backup or to serialize the data which is

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,965
only stored in the HealthKit store for a limited period of time.

21
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:27,340
Granola maps and validates the HealthKit API to OpenAM Health's HealthKit JSON schemas.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,550
Here's an example of that for step_count data from HealthKit

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,000
converted by Granola into OpenAM Health compliant JSON.
