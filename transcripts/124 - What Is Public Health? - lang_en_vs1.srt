1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,435
In this lesson, we will shift our attention to public and population health.

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:07,655
Unlike the clinical setting,

3
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:09,530
where the focus is traditionally on

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,589
individual patients after they become sick or injured,

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:19,895
public and population health focus on groups of patients or the public at large.

6
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,170
These can be as small as

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,650
a local neighborhood or as big as an entire country or region of the world.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,350
We will begin this lesson with the discussion of

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,995
public health and then discuss population health.

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:34,720
In a landmark report,

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,110
the Institute of Medicine define public health as,

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,680
"What we as a society do collectively to

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,425
assure the conditions in which people can be healthy."

14
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:49,910
Note the emphasis on collective action.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,870
This is a recognition that complex social factors have a powerful influence on

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,140
our health and that we require

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,220
disparate data sources to understand

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,175
the impact of many determinants of health and disease.

19
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:06,745
Also keep in mind that the World Health Organization,

20
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:12,000
a globally recognized public health organization defines health as,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
"The state of complete physical, mental,

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,850
and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."

23
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,505
From an informatics perspective,

24
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:29,115
many aspects of public health are similar to population health in that both aggregate,

25
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:33,855
analyze, and report on data as shown here.

26
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:38,105
Public health takes a broad view of the factors that influence health,

27
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,210
where you live and work,

28
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,820
the social norms of your culture,

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,920
the types of health care you have access to,

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,970
your exposure to diseases and stressors in your environment,

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,550
among other influences, to create this broad view.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,630
Public health uses disparate data sources to

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,615
fulfill its core functions and essential services.

34
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,530
Traditional health care is oriented around treating disease.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,410
Once that occurs, public health professionals try

36
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,810
to detect and prevent problems from happening or recurring.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,930
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC,

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,105
is the federal agency charged with protecting and improving public health,

39
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:28,175
but it generally does not collect surveillance information directly.

40
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,550
Rather, the US public health surveillance system relies on

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,225
established partnerships with more than 3,000 local agencies.

42
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:39,790
CDC works through these agencies to collect,

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,460
analyze and share data that address

44
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,435
the many factors and determinants of health and disease.

45
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:51,105
Since the key mission in public health is data aggregation and reporting,

46
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:55,350
inter-operability is obviously of great importance.

47
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,710
This is particularly true here in the US,

48
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,730
given the large number of reporting agencies in this country.

49
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,510
Globally, ministries of health are

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,895
the key agencies responsible for tracking cases of human illness.

51
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:12,885
Other important partners are community organizations,

52
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,975
the health care delivery systems,

53
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,650
schools, businesses, the transportation sector,

54
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,700
the media and other government agencies.

55
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,170
Data from public health surveillance

56
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,620
inform policies and direct decisions about resources for

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,245
services that promote healthy lifestyles and control the spread of infectious diseases.

58
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:38,270
Another major aspect of public health is promoting health care,

59
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,100
equity, quality, and accessibility.

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,375
Given the importance of inter-operability,

61
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:52,645
FIHR could potentially facilitate data aggregation and as we will see in what follows.

62
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:59,115
Public health experts increasingly see FIHR as an important health informatics tool.

63
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:02,610
CDC describes its mission as protecting America from

64
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,010
health safety and security threats wherever they originate.

65
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,820
We will now learn more about the CDC and

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,000
its mission and how informatics plays a key role in public health.
