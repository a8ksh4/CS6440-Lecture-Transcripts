1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,720
Thanks Dr. Granstein for having me and I'm happy to join.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chelsey Richards at CDC.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,376
I'm the Deputy Director for Public Health Scientific Services,

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:21,480
and I also direct the Office of Public Health Scientific Services.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,510
Sure. So I am a physician.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,215
I'm an internal medicine physician and geriatric physician.

7
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:32,810
I started my professional life after medical school and residency in a medical school,

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,445
running a division of general medicine and seeing patients.

9
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,320
I saw about 70 patients a week.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,950
And I think after several years of this,

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,750
I noticed that patients from rural Georgia were coming in with health problems,

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,755
were they had never had any preventive service for that, or any screening.

13
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:52,640
And it led me to thinking more about there ought to be ways to intervene beyond

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,720
just the intervention at an individual level which I did as a clinician,

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,190
but more at a population or community level,

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,065
and that's what brought me with an interest into public health.

17
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,445
I went and got additional schooling,

18
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:07,205
a Master's in public health.

19
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:12,155
And then, came to CDC as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer,

20
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,255
which a lot of people at CDC come in.

21
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,120
And for that two year fellowship, we went,

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,870
we got sent all over the place to investigate disease outbreaks.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,950
I went to Los Angeles.

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,120
I went to South America,

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,465
I went to Japan, I went to Taiwan.

26
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:32,000
In really investigating sort of an emerging problem,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,885
being able to quickly identify what the causes were and intervene.

28
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,840
And that was very fulfilling and has really been why I've stayed

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,916
in public health the last 20 years.

30
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:48,570
Well, CDC is a federal agency.

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,910
It's located in Atlanta. It's the only federal agency

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,780
that's headquartered out of the Washington D.C. area.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,505
We have about 15000 employees and a large budget.

34
00:01:56,505 --> 00:02:00,480
And we have staff in every state in the U.S. and 60 countries.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,390
And our mission is, to protect the safety,

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,275
health safety of Americans and globally.

37
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:12,530
And also, to promote prevention and health promotion.

38
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,490
Well, public health surveillance,

39
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,955
is the foundation of everything we do in public health.

40
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,900
And really what it is, is collecting data,

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,660
health data, to understand the burden,

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,335
the trends and what interventions really impact on health.

43
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:37,118
It's key to our preparedness as a nation to prevent health safety adverse events.

44
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:44,715
It's also key for understanding trends like obesity and other chronic diseases and what

45
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:53,025
interventions help us ameliorate these chronic diseases.

46
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,670
So public health surveillance,

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,725
as we were saying, is the foundation.

48
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:59,530
That data is the foundation of what we do in public health,

49
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,925
to know when to act,

50
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,340
where to act, what to do.

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,140
And most of our data in public health surveillance comes from the health care system.

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,060
And historically and traditionally,

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,190
that's been often a paper process,

54
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,370
where a doctor has to fill out a form by hand and

55
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,925
then maybe send it by mail or fax to a health department.

56
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:26,440
And then, a health department takes that and has to put it into a database to analyze it.

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,395
We're moving rapidly with electronic health records to an all electronic environment.

58
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,420
And I think the exciting thing for public health is that,

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,550
the speed with which we can get data now,

60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,020
allows us to take much quicker action to prevent disease outbreaks,

61
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,605
or to address in local communities specific pockets

62
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,875
of health problems or health conditions or diseases.

63
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:52,020
So I think, electronic health records and the ability to move data in

64
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,090
a digital format very fluidly between local clinicians,

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,820
hospitals, their local health departments,

66
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,415
their state health departments and CDC,

67
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:07,035
it's going to revolutionize the way public health can really protect

68
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:14,905
and support health promotion.

69
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:22,525
So, what this diagram really illustrates is the interconnectedness between health care,

70
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:26,865
public health, and many of the social factors that influence health.

71
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:31,060
And CDC and state and local health departments sit in that interface,

72
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,430
between the clinical system and the social,

73
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,761
what we call the social determinants of health.

74
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:39,280
And I think, what inner informatics and electronic health records

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,885
have the opportunity to give us,

76
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:47,105
is much better data moving between these various parts of the system.

77
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,415
So for example,

78
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:54,685
a huge public health problem we have in this country is the control of blood pressure.

79
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,220
We have about a third of the country has high blood pressure and

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,200
really controlling blood pressure is going to be so

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,900
critical to decrease deaths from heart disease and stroke.

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, there's a clinical portion to that,

83
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,165
which is a doctor being able to recognize high blood pressure,

84
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,870
being able to prescribe medications for a patient to

85
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,120
take those medications and get blood pressure under control.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,695
And that's information and data that's generated in the clinical system.

87
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,305
And health departments are very interested in that.

88
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,570
But we also know that things like,

89
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,395
access to good food, income, housing,

90
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:30,550
occupation, work, there are a lot of social factors that influence

91
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,600
on a person's ability to have normal blood pressure.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,735
And having more data which has been lacking for public health and for clinical medicine,

93
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,360
more data about that,

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,965
is going to help us understand,

95
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,260
where interventions in those social determinants

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,460
might have an impact on a particular help problem like high blood pressure.

97
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,730
Likewise, we understand, that for clinicians and for health departments for example,

98
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,915
with high blood pressure,

99
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:58,100
there was a medication that has to be prescribed

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,575
and we have to ensure that people are taking those medications.

101
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,310
And so, some of those data streams from pharmacies and from

102
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,665
other sources and increasingly from wearables that people,

103
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,950
devices that people wear that would monitor blood pressure.

104
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,460
As that data becomes available to the health care system and

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,560
public health it enables both of us to be able to

106
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,837
do more to get people to normal blood pressure.

107
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,630
So that's just one example of a health problem that is going to be

108
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,675
impacted dramatically by this movement of data,

109
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:29,940
from the various sectors I've discussed.

110
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,850
Yes. So, public health,

111
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,080
the foundation of public health is data and

112
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,810
surveillance data and analytics have been critical for

113
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,090
us to advance our understanding of health and to intervene and improve health.

114
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,200
Epidemiology has been sort of the bedrock science within public health.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:57,225
And traditional epidemiology looks for data to support causality of disease and then,

116
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,905
where trends of disease are going.

117
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:04,305
I think we have lacked in public health and in clinical medicine,

118
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,890
the ability to look at data in a big data context and really

119
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,573
be able to integrate all these various streams of data just mentioned.

120
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,700
And so, I think we're just beginning to learn in public health,

121
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,925
sort of the types of tools that are going to be needed,

122
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:23,635
in order to turn these vast amounts of data into knowledge that we can use.

123
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,545
And one thing that's critical to understand about public health and

124
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,860
the work that CDC does is that,

125
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,370
the work we do around data and analytics is not just to generate knowledge,

126
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,730
it's not just research.

127
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,015
But it's really data for action.

128
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,365
And we really have to take action at a local level,

129
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,810
at a regional level, state or national level or global level,

130
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,580
on the data analytics that we use.

131
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,070
So, as we become more comfortable with the big data analytic tools,

132
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,395
I think it's going to enable,

133
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:55,290
unleash a whole set of opportunities for us to

134
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,545
take better action when it needs to be more precise,

135
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:03,150
or bigger action globally, to really improve health.

136
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,090
One challenge that I'm concerned about is, signal to noise.

137
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,465
And so, when we think about big data analytics for example,

138
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:18,770
finding a signal in those big data may be

139
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,450
an important finding for us to be able to intervene early.

140
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,405
But what if it signals not quite right?

141
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,770
What if it's an association with a health problem,

142
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,990
but it's really not causing the problem?

143
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,680
And so, a lot of our work in epidemiology and surveillance is really not only

144
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,340
looking for associations between a signal and a disease,

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,470
or an outcome, but ensuring to

146
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,515
some extent that that signals really related in a real way,

147
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,379
because we're going to take action on that.

148
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:48,230
And so, that signal to noise problem is I think a real one.

149
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,150
I think, there are tools within

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,795
data analytics that will allow us to understand that better.

151
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,315
Machine learning, and other approaches

152
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,690
we're going to have to become more comfortable with,

153
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,075
to really harness the value there,

154
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:03,890
but that problem is going to still be one we're going to have to deal with.

155
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,900
I think another big issue that's relevant to your class and to the students,

156
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,380
who are taking these courses, is the workforce.

157
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,560
Most of our workforce and public health have been trained on

158
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,390
very traditional epidemiologic and other data analytical approaches.

159
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,430
We need a new fresh workforce that's going to have the tools

160
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,545
and experience with some of the newer tools of bigger data analytics.

161
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:31,820
And I think, how we bring people into public health is something I think about every day.

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,450
One thing that separates us from maybe the private sector,

163
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,195
we don't have maybe some of the incomes,

164
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,730
but we have a mission that is really compelling.

165
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,565
Because everyday, when we come in to work,

166
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:45,155
we're trying to save lives.

167
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:46,970
We're trying to prevent disability.

168
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,210
We're trying to promote health.

169
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,485
We're impacting not only people in our community,

170
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:51,905
but people all over the world.

171
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:55,400
And so, people who come to public health and really love it,

172
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,904
are there for that mission.

173
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:05,260
I think, one of the things that has been striking

174
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,910
with fire is the good enough syndrome, I would say.

175
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,400
We have in public health a tradition of wanting to get things just perfect,

176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,115
before we're comfortable with the way collect data.

177
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:22,420
And that delays our ability to get the data we need to take action.

178
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,820
And so, what's nice about fire in the modular concepts that are embedded in fire is,

179
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,950
we can get going. We can get data.

180
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,050
And as we learn more about a condition,

181
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,040
and many of our health conditions or disease outbreaks or epidemics are evolving,

182
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,465
so we're learning all the time.

183
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:44,440
We can improve that standard with other modular pieces and get more refined data,

184
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,400
but we don't have to delay our ability to get the data before we have it perfect.

185
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,780
So, the perfect is often the enemy of the good.

186
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,390
Let me try that again. The perfect is often the enemy of the good for us.

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,380
And I think fire fits into a model,

188
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:07,492
where we really need rapid data that we can analyze and act on.

189
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:12,000
So, I think that's a fantastic question,

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,995
because I've talked mostly about data,

191
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:17,490
but the other side of public health is this action that I keep talking about.

192
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,985
And I think apps offer us an opportunity to not only

193
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:25,390
harness the data that's there to tell us something about health or disease or epidemics,

194
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,090
but to immediately act.

195
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,010
To be able to send information back,

196
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,970
and tools back to that clinician to take action in the office.

197
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,800
To send it to public health.

198
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,240
To have information that can be from a local health department,

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,220
or a state health department.

200
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,760
Refine and into the hands of a clinician to be able to

201
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,720
counsel a patient on a health behavior issue.

202
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,980
So I think, apps really are an important part of the future for intervention,

203
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,380
which is again key to what we do. Great, thank you very much.
