1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,455
Sure. My name is Carmen Clelland and I do go by nickname of Skip,

2
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:11,020
so that's fine for Skip.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,190
I started my career within the India Health Service and

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,590
spent 20 plus years within clinical functions,

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,065
with India Health Service, and then also

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,335
administrative services within the India Health Service.

7
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:29,065
Later, past three years,

8
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,015
I've been working at the CDC.

9
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,500
During this period of time though,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,240
I've always had an interest in medication adherence,

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,900
the issues of medication here,

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,405
and what it means to a patient level, provider level,

13
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,280
public level as far as,

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,035
how can we identify ways to help provide solutions to

15
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:48,880
medication adherence and why is

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,160
such an important issue to address overall as a public health issue?

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,860
Sure. The apps that we we're looking at because of

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,100
the overall greater focus on public health medication adherence.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,620
Now, when I talk about that,

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,065
what I'm trying to explore is,

21
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:13,835
how can we use public health data along, or just regular,

22
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:18,170
even Big Data, along with the information that we would get from potentially,

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,770
a patient medical record through an EHR,

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,210
an aggregate data form for physicians,

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,950
for pharmacists, for patients,

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,275
for public health professionals,

27
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,600
in order to drive a change in dynamic,

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,270
and how people view medication adherence?

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,965
The goal was as if we were to identify how medication adherence is within a county,

30
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,345
or a census tract,

31
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:45,890
or in a case,

32
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,025
one of the areas that we were thinking of was a tribal tract,

33
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,260
and be able to say,

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,630
in this part of the city,

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,980
or this part of the reservation,

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,060
or this part in rural America,

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,160
or this part in a county,

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,275
that you know that your adherence rate on a certain medication is 60%.

39
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:07,160
Well, how can we identify that in order to

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,930
drive medication prescribing patterns, maybe drive education,

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,810
maybe drive other factors that might be involved,

42
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,820
even to planning of cities,

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,990
or planning of rural areas,

44
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,465
and making sure that we address it on a more public health role issue,

45
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:25,210
looking at population health,

46
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,285
then being able to help improve that patient's ability,

47
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:34,095
to have all the things they need in order to have better medication adherence practices.

48
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:37,990
That was the goal of this and it sounds kind of lofty.

49
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,495
One of the things I worked with the two teams,

50
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,390
and it's interesting because the interaction between the two teams was different too.

51
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,492
One was very engaged,

52
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,885
the other team was slightly engaged,

53
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,715
although they didn't need that subject matter expertise,

54
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,480
being a clinical pharmacist all those years,

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,645
I was able to provide that to that team with some information,

56
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:04,445
and then follow up and so I met with them maybe just a couple of times.

57
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,130
The other team though was more engaged,

58
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,790
they wanted to have some more input about what medication here it was,

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,990
why was it this issue?

60
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,205
Why did they think that FHIR technology

61
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:23,265
and being able to develop strategies to help support that technology in use.

62
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:26,830
A population health data could help solve this issue.

63
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,805
I went through with that team,

64
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:29,930
my thinking on this,

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,795
and why I thought this could be a way to look at it.

66
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,625
They were very much engaged,

67
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,560
and ended up developing

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,980
a nice framework concept that would lead to a proof of concept at some point,

69
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,350
in order to say, "Can we develop these applications using FHIR Technology,

70
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,810
Big Data, insurance claim information potentially Medicare claim, Medicare claim data?

71
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,955
All those things that can be accessible,

72
00:03:55,955 --> 00:04:02,930
and then using it to be able to use it as a population tool to help prescribers,

73
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,770
pharmacists, patients, and then public health professionals

74
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,340
that develop the right strategies to improve medication adherence."

75
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,250
Because, if we make just overall group strategy of doing medication adherence,

76
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,550
it may not apply to the person in inner city versus the person in the rural,

77
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,870
versus the person on a reservation,

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,705
versus the person living wherever they are,

79
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,090
and having better aggregate data in

80
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,015
those population areas that we want to really focus on,

81
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:33,290
will help drive better prescribing patterns from physicians,

82
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,240
better counseling from pharmacists,

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,720
better ability to take the medications from the patients,

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,030
and better public health campaigns from the public health practitioners.

85
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,670
That is the strategy on that.

86
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,350
The framework that the one team developed,

87
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,495
was called the Medication Adherence Support System Conceptual Architecture.

88
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:57,950
And what the goal of that,

89
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,475
was to look at it from that perspective,

90
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:03,890
of not only just always focusing on that patient perspective,

91
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,120
but looking to say,

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,855
"Who are all the people that need to interact with that?"

93
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:12,050
And then how does that interaction need to coordinate together,

94
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,210
to be able to drive the data into the interface,

95
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,820
and then being able to regurgitate it out in a way that is meaningful to that physician,

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,560
still meaningful to the patient,

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,180
meaningful to the pharmacist meaningful to all,

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,375
to the public health practitioner,

99
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,480
and supporting the overall goal of,

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
"I want that patient to be healthy,

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,250
I want to be able to take the medication and we know if they take their medication,

102
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,790
chances are they will have mostly success with whatever chronic disease,

103
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,010
or other issues that they're working to deal with."

104
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,670
And so, that was how that architecture was set up.

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,990
As you look at the architecture that they developed,

106
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,740
it really is strategic in nature,

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,185
where you can actually focus on various elements of this concept architecture,

108
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:03,850
and continue to develop,

109
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,700
we may be one module over here,

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,140
and another module later,

111
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,895
in order to some point,

112
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,435
in five years maybe,

113
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,650
have the full architecture put together,

114
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,520
that would then you could go out and use to be able to help

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,635
drive public health medication adherence,

116
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:24,240
and then eventually, affecting as a population strategy.

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,900
That's how the architecture was developed and it's very detailed

118
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,000
in how they came up with that conceptual architecture.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
What the team did,

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,595
that did the conceptual architecture,

121
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:39,690
they also worked on initial component of an app,

122
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,175
which is the Patient Facing App.

123
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,140
And probably for most of the apps that we see,

124
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,005
that's probably the easiest because it just requires patient data input,

125
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,630
as far as, "Did they take the medication?

126
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,955
What time of day did they take it?," those types of things.

127
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,540
There's a multitude of those out on the market.

128
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,660
That was the first strategy that both teams actually

129
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,420
ended up creating examples of their apps,

130
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,745
and doing that, and what that would look like.

131
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:11,215
Both of them had some good components to it with regards to,

132
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,950
when they miss doses, what was that,

133
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,715
or what was the cause of missed doses?

134
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:20,580
One of the things that I cautioned them on that is,

135
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,810
when you're talking about the patients,

136
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,230
there's this whole fatigue issue

137
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,970
of being overwhelmed by always having to put stuff into a program,

138
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,430
or having to hit a buzzer or something to that,

139
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,705
where eventually you start phasing it out,

140
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,920
and it just becomes background noise.

141
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,370
And how do we use that strategy in the future to help prevent these things?

142
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,905
Where you get your key information into those patients facing apps,

143
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:49,400
and then being able to retrieve that out at the other end,

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,910
so that way, the physicians,

145
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,650
and the pharmacists, and the public health people,

146
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,295
can have access to that information,

147
00:07:55,295 --> 00:08:00,435
clean of course, so that way it doesn't identify patients at a patient level,

148
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:02,115
but enough, where they can say,

149
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,160
"In this urban area,

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,275
in Atlanta, medications in ward

151
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:14,975
six is only taking hypertensive medications 40% of the time.

152
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,780
Why is in Ward 6 that is creating this as an overall thing?"

153
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,500
That way we would want to explore and then you'd be able to say,

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,060
"Now I can do it, because I have the data.

155
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,935
I can go to my city planner,

156
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:28,230
I can go to the pharmacist,

157
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,585
I can go detail physicians,

158
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,260
and let them know this is a strategy that they can do."

159
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,210
And so that's how the architecture was set up to do,

160
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,010
to be able to support that,

161
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,590
and make it into something that's workable,

162
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,380
usable, and eventually in the end,

163
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,664
be something that can make an impact.

164
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,970
I think the next step,

165
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,135
it needs to go in a couple of different phases.

166
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,280
Clearly, there's work done initially on the patient phase,

167
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,935
but it's not complete as the way these were.

168
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,805
I can't remember how many weeks the sessions were

169
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:06,505
so they had limit time with their team together.

170
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,495
There's still need to work on that patient app.

171
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:12,600
There needs to be development on how to build in the FHIR Technology,

172
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,705
bringing in the FHIR Technology,

173
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,910
along with Big Data to incorporate,

174
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,030
so you can start seeing conceptually,

175
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,880
how Big Data impacts decision-making at a county, census tract,

176
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,920
tribal tract, other population modalities of how you to

177
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,255
identify groups of people and then bring that into an application.

178
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:39,440
Because I think that's when you'll start seeing how you can drive this information.

179
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
There's plenty of patient apps out

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,700
there that you might be able to get some information from,

181
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,870
and I'm sure there's a lot of people,

182
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,520
skilled and looking at it from that perspective since that's

183
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,010
the most common way people would use to help say,

184
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,060
"I can help improve adherence."

185
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,945
But then driving in this other point,

186
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,385
so I think the next phase for me,

187
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:00,200
and what we're looking at with this,

188
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,240
is to drive that population health data

189
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,570
gathering along with access to some sort of patient records system,

190
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,360
that includes claims data, those types of things.

191
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,616
That would be able to make this a more comprehensive look at medication adherence.

192
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:23,630
Then with that, look at that population health part of it,

193
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,650
and then saying, "How can we affect health equity because of what we're using?"

194
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,320
Now with data making decisions versus

195
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,925
the anecdotal information you tend to get from patients, "I'll take this",

196
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,080
or the late dose,

197
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,260
"I'm going to start taking this a week for my doctor's appointments,

198
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,220
so that way doesn't look like I'm not," or other things.

199
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,110
And it's not necessarily all the patients fault,

200
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,210
it's just the way our system is set up,

201
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,455
to not necessarily look at medication adherence as an issue,

202
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:52,730
it's more or less,

203
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,260
the chronic disease issue.

204
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,685
But if you're spending hundreds of billions dollars a year on medications,

205
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:01,625
and there's a lot of that being wasted,

206
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,160
then we're looking at also something that can have

207
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,890
an impact on our health care of our system overall,

208
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,550
as well as our public health systems overall too.

209
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:19,060
So that's the next strategy on this. Thank you.
