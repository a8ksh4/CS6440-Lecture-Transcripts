1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,130
Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much Dr. Bronstein for having me here and for

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,295
allowing me to mentor your students during the spring 2017 semester.

3
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:20,920
So, I am a full time employee and

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,600
graduate student at the UT Health School of Public Health, Brownsville Regional Campus.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,840
So Brownsville is down at the US-Mexico border.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,570
It's the farthest tip in Texas.

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,595
I've been there for about three years

8
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:38,130
and I've been working in health informatics for about four years.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,905
So I graduated from the UT Austin Health Informatics Program,

10
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:45,370
they have a certificate program in Austin,

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,080
before coming to this job.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,730
And I worked with our local regional health information exchange,

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,310
the Rio Grande Valley Health Information Exchange,

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,000
to connect to clinics and hospitals in the region,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,695
and also work on an initiative called Project Diabetes and Obesity Control

16
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,900
which is a project from the UT system to basically

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,930
integrate data from data sources other than electronic health records so that we

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,870
can bring care to outside the four walls of the clinic.

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:27,398
Absolutely.

20
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:31,865
I'm really interested in

21
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:35,090
this concept of bringing data outside of

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,656
the clinical environment to the clinical environment.

23
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:43,310
Go for it.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,600
Earlier in the course, I introduced them to the term real world data.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,125
Real world data.

26
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,780
Okay, perfect.

27
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,267
That's probably the new term.

28
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:51,870
Okay, great.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,498
You might regarding this term. So let's do that.

30
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:59,290
Okay, perfect. Perfect.

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:01:59,475
Should I ask the question earlier?

32
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,170
Yeah.

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,230
So, can you prompt me again? Sorry.

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,310
What was the project and why is it important?

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,605
I am very interested in the concept of

36
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,445
real world data and bringing in real world data

37
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:17,690
into the clinical environment so that practitioners and patients,

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,280
too, can be empowered with this data to make decisions about their health.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,895
I'm specifically interested in the nutrition domain.

40
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:35,420
The project I proposed was to create a FHIR application to visualize

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,395
results from a nutrition algorithm that takes components from purchases.

42
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:47,075
It takes the physical items that were purchased from a grocery store,

43
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,080
scores them from zero to 100,

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,323
and comes up with an aggregate score,

45
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,905
displaying that alongside of data from electronic health records for

46
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:04,450
providers and for patients.

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,760
Right. Exactly. It's an approximation of their eating habits.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,020
There's another algorithm out there called the Healthy Eating Index and that can

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:23,685
be used to identify the nutrient quality of the food supply or of an individual's diet.

50
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:30,040
And it's always approximating their diet.

51
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,082
You never know if what they bought is what they're actually going to consume.

52
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:41,225
But you can come close to assume that if this is the food that's in their house,

53
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,775
that's their food supply, that's probably what they're going to be eating.

54
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:49,995
And also, it's probably closely correlated with the personal choices they make.

55
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,155
If they buy vegetables from the grocery store,

56
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:56,455
they're probably eating healthy outside of the grocery environment.

57
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,380
But if they buy just meat and sugar,

58
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,415
that's probably what they're eating outside the grocery store as well.

59
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,365
But there's some studies.

60
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:09,800
I think, there was a study in 2012 that sampled,

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,980
I think it was a smaller area.

62
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,440
They identified, 60-80 percent of

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,330
people's food consumption comes from the grocery store and convenience stores.

64
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,700
We can make a pretty sure assumption

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,830
that the food that people are buying are what they're eating.

66
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,355
Absolutely.

67
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:42,650
There are a few nutrition algorithms that currently exist.

68
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,950
There's definitely a need for additional nutrition algorithms.

69
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,015
The one that I mentioned,

70
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,260
the Healthy Eating Index,

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,995
is actually far away from being implementable in a real world setting,

72
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:01,205
to actually use the data from purchases to approximate a healthy eating index score.

73
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,960
There are a few,

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,885
so Healthy Eating Index is one.

75
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:07,225
There's also a front-of-package labeling system called

76
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:11,980
Nouvelle which was developed by faculty at the Yale School of Public Health.

77
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,260
And they don't allow you, actually,

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,215
to aggregate the scores from the individual products that are purchased.

79
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:24,155
And then a third that we decided to use for our project is NutriSavings.

80
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:28,065
So they claim 85 percent market share in the US.

81
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:32,460
And one of their partners is Wal-Mart.

82
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,230
That probably accounts for most of the 85% market share.

83
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:43,040
But what NutriSavings does is they work with

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,160
employer-based insurance programs to score people's purchases,

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,830
the covered participants' purchases,

86
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,285
and they provide that information to the covered entity and also to the consumers.

87
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:03,230
We worked with them to get a sample data spec

88
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,557
and built sample data to populate our application.

89
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:15,080
The goals of the semester were to basically

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,935
create a mock application

91
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:22,696
that demonstrates the ability to combine these two data sources,

92
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:27,740
electronic health records and the purchasing data, nutrition algorithms,

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,590
in hopes that grocery stores will see this,

94
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,285
the potential of use of this real world data,

95
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:38,210
and would be more willing to share their data.

96
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,950
That's one thing that NutriSavings is kind of crippled with right now.

97
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,880
And I actually personally asked some retailers but they're reluctant

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,095
to share their data outside of the four walls of their facilities.

99
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,420
But we can look at the application now.

100
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,280
I think it would be good to show you the back end of our system

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,605
and how we imagine a clinic

102
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:03,420
working with a local grocery store to enable this application.

103
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,165
in this diagram, it's a bit complicated but I hope I can talk through it well,

104
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:11,745
we have data providers on the left.

105
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:15,170
These are electronic health records who are in

106
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,575
the area and these are clinics that have electronic health records.

107
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:25,395
And then, we have a grocery store partner and an imagined interchange or

108
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:28,295
some database that can take in the data

109
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:32,330
from the electronic health records and from grocery stores.

110
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,570
Ideally, this will be a FHIR compliant server that has

111
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,980
some other storage means for the grocery data or even,

112
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:46,070
I guess, the software application could query NutriSavings and get the data in real time.

113
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:52,070
We basically designed this for a local model.

114
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,040
We have a partner that is providing us with an interchange.

115
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,665
We wanted to implement this project after the spring.

116
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:03,715
This is why we have in this way.

117
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,710
And then we have Georgia Institute of Technology here

118
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,810
designing the front-end applications that we query for our compliant server.

119
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,470
Here, if a clinic is interested in becoming involved,

120
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,370
to get an absolute match to not have

121
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,345
to use a patient matching over them which we could absolutely use,

122
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:33,083
we would have the provider give the patient a NutriSavings,

123
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,670
calls it an employee ID because they usually work with employer-based insurance programs,

124
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,220
to track the patient.

125
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,285
And typically, NutriSavings works with rewards cards

126
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:48,530
to track people across grocery stores.

127
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:56,270
And the participant would take the rewards card to the grocery store and scan it at

128
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,710
a participating grocery store which would identify them across

129
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,645
the electronic health record and with

130
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:08,608
a grocery store and would allow that data to be shared with NutriSavings.

131
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:12,985
And NutriSavings currently generates

132
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:19,880
three types of data so they can provide a trip score for individual grocery trips,

133
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,285
items received at those trips,

134
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:28,303
and then also a monthly summary for that participant.

135
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:31,690
We thought it would be good to

136
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,370
allow the provider to see all these different types of granularity.

137
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,180
But also see a monthly score at the high level.

138
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,725
I'll show you the front-end application now.

139
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:50,115
The front-end application, we have Jane Smith here.

140
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:52,510
We decided to make this as simple as possible

141
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,630
for this could be a registered dietitian or a provider.

142
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,885
During our spring project,

143
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:05,955
we interviewed two register dietitians and two M.D.s for the project.

144
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:13,200
And then, we also had some consultation from a consulting firm.

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,420
And this just basically shows a tiled view of

146
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:27,660
different relevant clinical items from FHIR resources, from the EMR.

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,285
We have like a respiratory rate, hemoglobin A1C, glucose,

148
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:36,145
HDL, LDL, BMI and the actual nutrition score.

149
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:41,170
We could integrate additional metrics as needed.

150
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,990
But these were some that the registered dietitian thought were

151
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,570
important for further practice.

152
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,530
We have a high level of view here where

153
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,728
the provider can see all of these different tiles,

154
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,640
and if they click into one,

155
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,550
we're clicking into the nutrition score,

156
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:03,095
they get a graph view that shows the monthly summary for the patient over time.

157
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:08,355
And if the provider were to click into any of these month points,

158
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:13,200
they could see the trip summaries over time as well.

159
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,750
This was a very simple tool.

160
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,710
We wanted to do a minimal viable product but

161
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,315
some things that we think could be incorporated are like a notes function,

162
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,350
a goal setting function.

163
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,576
Unfortunately with this, we don't have a very high level of granularity.

164
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,445
We're only seeing the monthly score and the individual scores.

165
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:46,005
This nutrition index just shows the nutrient density of different items purchased.

166
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,190
Somebody, for example, somebody could

167
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,710
just buy apples for an entire month and their score would be 100, right?

168
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,215
The scale is from one to 100.

169
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:02,185
But just eating apples is not enough to fulfill all of your nutritional requirements.

170
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:06,150
I think there's a huge need to get

171
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,757
more granular data from grocery stores and actually like working with NutriSavings,

172
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:11,880
they weren't able to share

173
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,685
that granular data and they're only able to share these nutrition scores,

174
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:17,165
these aggregate nutrition scores.

175
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:21,450
I think it's absolutely necessary that we get more granular data both so that we can

176
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,385
develop additional algorithms that are more granular,

177
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:31,485
and so that we could actually provide clinical decision support.

178
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:36,015
I think, I love the CDS Hooks Initiative that's going on right now.

179
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:40,650
I think would be great if we could build some CDS Hooks that are relevant

180
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:46,635
to nutrition and we need access to that granular data.

181
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,545
I'm hoping that as we build more of these applications,

182
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,840
we can use this to show grocery stores that

183
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,021
there's utility for this data and hoping that if we build it,

184
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,940
they'll come and they'll give it to us.

185
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,490
I think that's a good overview of the software application.
