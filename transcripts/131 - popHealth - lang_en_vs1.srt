1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,305
We began this course with a discussion of the critical problem of chronic disease.

2
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:10,580
We learned that it accounts for most US health care costs and that

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,575
the design of our health care system is not well suited to chronic disease management.

4
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:19,555
To correct this, we discussed the need for new care models,

5
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:22,885
better design for the management of these diseases.

6
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:26,540
We also discussed the critical role that patient behaviors

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,325
play in the development of chronic disease and in its successful management.

8
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,970
Finally, provider reimbursements in

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,490
the new care and payment models we discussed earlier in

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,310
the course are usually based on care quality and clinical outcome metrics.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,880
In the next segment,

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,440
we will see that Population Health began in response to the need of

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,930
providers to understand and improve their performance against these metrics.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,620
Like public health, it is an important use case for

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,370
interoperability since individual providers in some network or

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,800
system that is contracted to deliver

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,060
cost effective outcomes will usually have different EHR's.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,960
Finally, we will also learn that like virtually all other domains of Health Informatics,

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,840
population health is increasingly employing

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,320
analytic technologies to predict and proactively manage clinical results.
