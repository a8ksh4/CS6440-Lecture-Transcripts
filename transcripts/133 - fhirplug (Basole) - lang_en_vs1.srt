1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,270
My name is Rahul Basole.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm a professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,320
I also lead the Initiative on Enterprise Transformation at Georgia Tech,

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,540
where we study large complex enterprise systems.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,850
My particular research area is on visual analytics and visualization and I've applied it

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,910
to many problems in healthcare.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,280
Sure.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,250
So it turns out that process mining is actually

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,670
a relatively old field in many other domains and health care.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,300
Manufacturing certainly is one of those domains,

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,385
where you've had very detailed process charts on how

12
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:47,110
widgets and products actually move across the manufacturing belt.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,785
In healthcare actually, we have a complete different process situation.

14
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,680
It's much more complex.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,655
In fact, when you go into an healthcare enterprise,

16
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,990
it's very unlikely that you see very detailed process maps.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,360
The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Project actually is

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,540
a result of some of the other efforts that we've had before,

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,925
where we realized that scaling,

20
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:10,730
process mining and analysis jobs is really difficult.

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,005
In the old days, you would walk around with a clipboard and observe how people did work.

22
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,140
And incredibly time consuming, resource intensive.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,390
In some cases it might take three to six months to

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,390
actually get things really accurately done.

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,250
With Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,965
our goal was to reverse engineer data that already existed in electronic health records,

27
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,600
maybe in claims data,

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,680
to understand how processes actually happen, how they get done.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:46,200
Perhaps understand how these processes fit together and understand variations in care.

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,415
Absolutely. So as I mentioned,

31
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:54,085
my research area is visual analytics and visualization.

32
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:57,990
So, really exposing the processes is really critical.

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,410
And so, what you're seeing here is a screenshot of a tool that

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,235
we've developed that visualizes these complex care processes.

35
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:06,600
On the left hand side,

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,685
you'll see a panel where you can filter

37
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,415
through various aspects of the patient population.

38
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:14,830
So you can focus down on elements of interest.

39
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,050
And you're seeing a graph and network modeling approach to understand how care happens.

40
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,925
The nodes represent activities and events.

41
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:26,737
And, the edges represent whether they co-occurred,

42
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:29,715
and when they actually happen after each other.

43
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,680
It's been a fascinating process,

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,655
because we actually discovered variations in care by population characteristics,

45
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:40,600
as well as by physician characteristics.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,725
And the goal was really to discover processes,

47
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:48,800
identify variations and hopefully also enhance these processes.

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,100
One byproduct of this was also to understand conformance to the processes.

49
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,355
Many physicians have guidelines on how care should be done.

50
00:02:56,355 --> 00:03:03,886
And our visualizations really revealed what happened and what didn't happen.

51
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,800
Yes.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,925
So process mining,

53
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,095
you want to look at a population.

54
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,290
But sometimes that population is just too large and

55
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,250
there's just too much variation that happens within that.

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,210
So you want to hone down, filter down the ideas.

57
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:24,200
And so, given the advent of fhir and the ability to have access to digital data now,

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,505
we wanted to figure out how we could build a population health analysis tool.

59
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:31,520
Based on the ideas of visualization and analytics,

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,435
that could dynamically explore different patient characteristics,

61
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,090
by different population characteristics.

62
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,375
So ultimately, we built a tool called fhirplug,

63
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,380
which leverages the fire standard.

64
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,610
And, as you recall,

65
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,510
fhir really was not designed to look at all an entire population.

66
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,665
It was built really to look at one record at a time.

67
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,215
So fhirplug is a tool that aggregates

68
00:03:56,215 --> 00:04:03,360
this information and allows you to really filter through multiple facets of that data.

69
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,830
So let's take a look at fhirplug here.

70
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,680
It's a web-based visualization tool.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,070
What do you see on the left hand panel and ability to load your data set,

72
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,825
your fhir enabled data set.

73
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,470
And then, you can focus down on specific aspects that you want to look

74
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,246
for certain search criteria, a condition perhaps.

75
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:25,990
And once you've load that in,

76
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,875
you see five tabs at the top which actually reveals to you that it's an overview.

77
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,740
It's about process characteristics,

78
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,530
about patient demographics, as well as develops clinical elements.

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,540
And each of these tabs is fully coordinated.

80
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,260
That's very powerful in visualization,

81
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,760
when you coordinate multiple views to get a triangulated perspective on the data.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,245
We're using across filtering mechanisms.

83
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,627
So, as you are filtering through one of the charts,

84
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,284
you can actually see what,

85
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:53,965
how it response in the other ones.

86
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:57,325
We've enabled multiple visualization charts within this,

87
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,075
including scatter plot and heat maps.

88
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:03,640
And this really allows the decision maker

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,270
or the clinician or also quality managers to look at their patient population.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,455
Well, there is a lot of enhancements that we can obviously do to fhirplug.

91
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:20,610
Fhirplug right now, we tested it out on some synthetic large,

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,630
synthetic data sets, as well as in practice as well.

93
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,314
But we realize there's a lot of nuances,

94
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,145
because healthcare data is very messy.

95
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,520
As you scale up, there might be some issues that we

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,285
might discover that fhirplug cannot handle.

97
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:35,160
Scalability is certainly always an issue in software development.

98
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,665
And so the next steps will be,

99
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,330
to test it out with multiple healthcare sites,

100
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,670
test out scalability and see where that goes. Thank you.
