1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:06,520
This lesson does not provide details on how to do analytics.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,100
Rather we will explore

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,130
the specialized infrastructures and tools that support research on,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,355
an exploration of, health data at scale.

5
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,075
Generally this involves aggregating

6
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:25,140
at least the clinical part of that data from a large number of

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,560
digital health records.This introduces

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,590
the interoperability issues we've been discussing throughout the course.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,160
Advanced analysis of these big health data sets offers the promise of more precise,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,260
personalized care and the use of

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,880
predictive tools to anticipate and treat clinical problems much

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,100
earlier than was possible in the past.This

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,420
analysis must overcome many typical problems and limitations of the HR data.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,650
Despite the challenges we are clearly heading into a new era of medicine and health care.

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,000
This lesson provides you with at least a feel for what that might be like.
