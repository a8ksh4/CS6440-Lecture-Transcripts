00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,205
The world is awash in data.

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:06,900
It is growing at exponential rates.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,485
People have coined the term big data,

4
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:11,555
to refer to this phenomenon,

5
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:14,575
but often can't agree on what it means.

6
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:18,825
What separates big data from everything else?

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,040
Cesar Hidalgo at MIT Media Lab,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,980
says that to qualify for this distinction,

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,010
data must be big in size, resolution and scope.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,385
To re-frame this idea,

11
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:37,545
in a way that is directly relevant to transforming health care delivery systems,

12
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:41,450
data must represent many patients and providers.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,705
It must do so in detail,

14
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:46,923
and as we will now discuss,

15
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:51,190
it must be combined with other data to give the real world context,

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,905
within which patients live and get sick,

17
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:58,030
care is delivered, and the delivery system operates.
