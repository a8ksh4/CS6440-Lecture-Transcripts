1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Real world data is a relatively new term

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,500
encompassing data derived from a number of sources shown

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,920
here that affect clinical outcomes in

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,380
a heterogeneous patient population in real world settings.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,410
Earlier in his interview,

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,950
John Duke use the term observational data and

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,980
it is essentially a synonym for real world data.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,490
We also refer to this kind of data in our discussions of public and population health.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,750
So, their impact goes far beyond individual patient care.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,670
The hope is that analysis of this

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,720
richer and broader data set will generate meaningful insights into

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,080
unmet needs and interventional strategies with

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,810
greater clinical and economic impact on patients and health care systems.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,170
There are of course as shown here new challenges

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,445
introduced when the range and scope of data sources expands.

16
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:03,605
Understand the potential value of real world data.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,630
I suggest you read a short but interesting and insightful article by

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,558
a trio of researchers at Harvard's Center for biomedical informatics.

19
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:22,240
This diagram from it

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,660
organizes potential health data sets along different dimensions of bigness.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,280
The authors point out that while electronic health records provide depth by including

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,100
multiple sources of data such as images and

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,855
clinical notes about individual patient encounters,

24
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:45,170
claims data provide longitudinally,

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,850
a less clinically detail but more continuous view of

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,225
a patient's medical history over an extended time period.

27
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,650
Medical data may be episodic and

28
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,720
incomplete if a patient receives care from multiple providers.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,860
Typically, there's only one payer for a time period so that payers

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,845
claims from within that period should be a more complete record of care delivered.

31
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,380
On the other hand,

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,660
claims data lacks clinical detail.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,185
A request for payment for a lab test order would be in a claim

34
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:23,985
but the results would not be included as they usually are in any H.R.

35
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:28,180
As a result, the authors of this paper say,

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,790
"linking data adds value when they help fill in the gaps.

37
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,900
With this in mind, it becomes easier to see how nontraditional sources of

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,230
biomedical data outside of the healthcare system fit into the picture.

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,730
Social media, credit card purchases,

40
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,545
census records and numerous other types of data despite varying degrees of quality,

41
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:57,395
can help assemble a holistic view of a patient and in particular

42
00:02:57,395 --> 00:03:04,230
shed light on social and environmental factors that may be influencing them."
