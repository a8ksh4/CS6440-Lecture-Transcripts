1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,815
Health care is a diverse and rich field for research and analytics.

2
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:11,168
We will now consider a few examples to explore that diversity.

3
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:15,230
The historic gold standard for developing new medical knowledge,

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,080
is the controlled clinical trial.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,030
You have two equivalent,

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,610
randomly selected patient groups,

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,090
alternate therapies are a new therapy and

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,520
a placebo and see which group does better over time.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,020
These are difficult to do.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,180
Finding and recruiting the right patients is hard.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,243
These trials take a long time and they're expensive.

12
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,990
However, if the question is whether a new treatment works

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,130
better than current treatments in actual human patients,

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,651
there's currently not a good alternative approach.

15
00:00:55,651 --> 00:01:01,105
Next, we will consider the problem of early diagnosis of the disease.

16
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:04,120
Congestive heart failure occurs when

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,955
the heart muscle does not pump blood as well as it should.

18
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:11,070
It affects 5.7 million people in

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,875
the United States and there are over 200,000 new cases each year.

20
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,680
A 2013 paper, calculates that

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,235
the total direct cost of heart failure is from 60 to $150 billion annually.

22
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:31,770
According to a review article in Mayo Clinical Proceedings,

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:39,040
quote "No single test can be used to establish the clinical diagnosis of heart failure.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,350
Instead, history and physical examination findings showing

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,240
signs and symptoms of congestion and are in Organ hypoperfusion,

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,820
are used to make the diagnosis.

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,555
Imaging studies documenting systolic or diastolic dysfunction

28
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:59,135
and Byer markers, are helpful adjuncts.

29
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:06,490
Thus, the diagnosis of congestive heart failure may require many types of clinical data.

30
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,190
A point you should remember when I interviewed Dr. Jimeng Sun in the next segment.

31
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,910
Providing help for this problem comes from predictive analytics,

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,290
his area of research.

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,930
Finally, a different question,

34
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,330
what is the optimal treatment strategy among

35
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,101
already known and available options for a given group of patients?

36
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,690
As opposed to the classic research questions determining optimal treatment,

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,720
will require many alternative experiments.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,905
That is, trying every possible treatment strategy on groups of similar patients.

39
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:50,180
These types of questions are best addressed through

40
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,755
modeling and simulation using digital health data.

41
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,480
There are a number of techniques for doing this.

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,620
Again, this is not an analytics lesson,

43
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,860
but we will be interviewing researchers who do this kind of

44
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,000
work to get a high level view of it in healthcare.
