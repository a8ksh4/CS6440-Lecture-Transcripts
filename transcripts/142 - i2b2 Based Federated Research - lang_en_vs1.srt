1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,875
The National Institutes of Health Clinical and translational science awards program CTSA,

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:16,755
seeks to facilitate that translation of research into clinical practice.

3
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:20,430
Harvard Medical School has created SHRIN,

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,895
the shared health research informatics network.

5
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:27,108
A web based software network,

6
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:32,400
SHRIN links the respective I2B2 instances of five of

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,050
Harvard's CTSA partner hospitals for the sharing of aggregated counts of patients.

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,365
Meaning selected inclusion and exclusion criteria for demographics,

9
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:50,405
diagnoses, medications and lab tests.

10
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:55,210
The goal is for SHRIN to enable population based research,

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,440
assessment of potential clinical trial cohorts and

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,465
hypothesis formation for follow up study by combining the H.R.

13
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:08,197
assets across the hospital systems.

14
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:10,960
The department of biomedical informatics at

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,400
Harvard Medical School is working with health care centers across the

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,530
U.S. to develop the scalable collaborative infrastructure for

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,302
learning health system S C I L H S, pronounced Schils.

18
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:31,948
Each site will install a software suite comprised of

19
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:38,850
I2B2 creating a federated query and response system using SHRIN,

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,130
the smart platform, the Indivio PHR and

21
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,000
the redcap research electronic data capture tool used to survey patients online.
