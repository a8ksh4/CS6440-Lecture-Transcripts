1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
There is of course,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,180
great interest in and potential for genomics research.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:14,100
Earlier, we mentioned personalized or precision medicine as a major goal for health care.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,815
While social, environmental and other factors

5
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:21,610
clearly affect the development and course of disease,

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,120
genomic variations are a major determinant

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,435
of each person's health and response to treatments.

8
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,810
There are at least two major challenges that informatics,

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,305
supplied to large genomic data sets can help solve.

10
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:41,035
Many genomic variations are rare,

11
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:45,170
so aggregating data from multiple centers is important.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,400
It's often necessary to correlate these variations with clinical data,

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,270
to understand their ramifications.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,320
It's worth repeating that last point.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,365
We do not yet understand the ramifications of most genomic variations.

16
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:07,490
By linking clinical data where the phenotypic expression

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,660
of genomic variations is stored with the genomic data,

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,500
the hope is that we can understand these relationships.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,025
Genomic research networks may overcome these challenges.

20
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:25,770
For example, three major pediatric health systems

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,105
recently formed the Genomics Research and Innovation Network, GRIN.

22
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:37,960
Because each alone may have only a handful of patients with a particular rare disease,

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,560
to help better understand the clinical ramifications of gene variations,

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,253
GRIN seeks to create a broad database of annotated genomic and clinical data.

25
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:55,270
It will add RNA proteomics and

26
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,709
metabolomic data to an existing shared library of genomic sequencing data.

27
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,300
The network also wants to connect

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,160
the genomic data with imaging results and electronic health records.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,705
The initial focus is on early childhood obesity,

30
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:18,565
growth disorders, short stature, and epilepsy.

31
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:24,270
The epilepsy project explores epileptic encephalopathy,

32
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,690
a process where epileptic activity impairs overall brain function,

33
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,260
including cognitive function, language and behavior.

34
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,700
As you can see here,

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,609
in data from online mundanely inheritance in man holmium,

36
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,165
a number of genes may have an association with this condition.

37
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,840
Once exome sequencing is completed,

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,485
the data is to be stored in a joint shared cloud environment,

39
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:57,760
combined with extracted phenotypic data from

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,450
the electronic medical records of the three centers,

41
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,020
in an effort to better elucidate and understand these relationships.
