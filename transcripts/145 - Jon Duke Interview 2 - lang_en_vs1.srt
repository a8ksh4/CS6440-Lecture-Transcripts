1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,100
Sure. So, the OHDSI tools were really designed to bring together the set

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,280
of most common tool kits that people would use for doing observational clinical research.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,495
So, if you wanted to ask a question of a health data set,

4
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:25,060
what OHDSI has done is brought together in one package,

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,440
which we call ATLAS, a set of tools to understand your population,

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,060
to understand individual cohorts within that population,

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,790
and to be able to explore those pre-clinical research questions.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,405
It's actually a nice compliment between FHIR and in OHDSI.

9
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,715
In that, FHIR typically is that the individual patient level pulling data down.

10
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:46,775
Where OHDSI really typically looks things at a population level or at a cohort level.

11
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,330
So, they're very complementary in fact.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,910
Sure, absolutely.

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,770
So, indeed ATLAS does roll together all of

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,695
these different components that are part of doing observational research.

15
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,770
So, as you can see here,

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,690
there's an initial piece which is around data set exploration.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,870
And if you look here,

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,575
and you click through to the individual dataset explorer,

19
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,445
you can pick a dataset of interest,

20
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:17,090
you can look graphically at the populations,

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,790
you can look at how many people are taking different medications,

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,480
how many people have different conditions on their list.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,265
So, that's a key part of understanding,

24
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,570
"What do I have to begin with?

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,370
What does my population look like?"

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,795
But if I want to go to the next level and build a particular cohort,

27
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:35,075
which you would do if you were going to ask a question.

28
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:40,185
For example, how many patients over 50 with diabetes are taking Metformin.

29
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,360
Well, if you want to define,

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,340
"What do I mean by patients with diabetes?"

31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,215
And to do that, we use the cohort builder tool over here.

32
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,190
And by clicking through the cohort builder,

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,410
you have an option you can see to graphically create and select a series of

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,630
different conditions that are relevant to diabetes.

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,705
You can select medications that are relevant to diabetes and laboratories,

36
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,150
and those are all defined in this way here.

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,605
You pick a concept set.

38
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:10,560
That concept set is then created by a vocabulary explorer.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,720
The vocabulary explorer says, "Let me look at

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,775
Metformin medications or other diabetes drugs.

41
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:24,340
Let me look at ICD 9 codes that mean diabetes and then go up to the parent level,

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,645
that can include SNOMED concepts,

43
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,890
ICD 10 concepts, and so forth."

44
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,580
And you roll those into concept sets.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,450
So, the way that this vocabulary explorer complements

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,410
the cohort builder is to allow you to create your little bundles of,

47
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,595
when I say diabetes here's what I mean in terms of codes.

48
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:46,560
By doing this, we can then run these population level estimation analysis,

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,800
which is that final piece of ATLAS, where you can say,

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,820
"I want people who have diabetes and have taken metformin and I want

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,255
people who have diabetes and have taken other medications such as sulfonylureas,

52
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,555
and I can look at the outcomes."

53
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,810
And that can be looking at, for example, myocardial infarction.

54
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,911
So by creating these three cohorts are what we call a treatment cohort,

55
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,570
what we call a comparator cohort,

56
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,785
and our outcome cohort,

57
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,480
we can then automatically run through

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,230
the ATLAS tool a very sophisticated analysis which is rigorous and

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,520
actually publishable almost directly from the code that's run

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,930
in the ATLAS tool.

61
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,140
Exactly. And so one of

62
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,960
the major initiatives that we're taking on this year here at Georgia Tech,

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,390
in collaboration with our colleagues at Stanford

64
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,360
is building a formalized Fino type library.

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
Where people can review what were

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,650
the conditions that were considered in designing a given phenotype.

67
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,535
What was the performance in terms of the precision and recall of a given cohort.

68
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:48,880
And provide additional information,

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,485
so that if someone wants to reuse this cohort in their own environment,

70
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:55,015
what they can expect in terms of its performance.

71
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:59,100
We also encourage people who do run studies to upload their own findings.

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,585
As far as how well did this definition do in my local system,

73
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:06,675
and it then allows us to produce better and better cohorts to share with the rest

74
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:13,095
of the OHDSI community.

75
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a really exciting time.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,770
I think for OHDSI as a community that has

77
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,583
now grown well beyond its roots looking just at drug safety,

78
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:27,641
into where with people considering studies around genomics and around value based care,

79
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,920
certainly looking at population health at large.

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
We've even had a number of people say,

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,353
"We want to look at clinical trials themselves using OHDSI,

82
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:35,900
" which is interesting given

83
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,335
the original ideas around observational research and clinical trials being separate.

84
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,617
The other big piece though, is with FHIR,

85
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:48,515
we're now seeing a easier pathway to go from EMR data of all stripes,

86
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:52,775
and from all different systems into an OHMOP common data model.

87
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:57,560
That GT on FHIR or OHMOP on FHIR project done here at Georgia Tech,

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,235
allows people to very rapidly implement a conversion from

89
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:05,720
FHIR into OHMOP and take advantage of all the tools that OHMOP has.

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,190
At the same time, if someone builds

91
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,010
a predictive model using advanced machine learning methods,

92
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,380
many of which have been developed here at Georgia Tech,

93
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,420
or extensively refined here at Georgia Tech,

94
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,100
those predictive models can then be run through

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,215
an EMR system to actually do a prediction for individual patient.

96
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,960
So, the connection between clinical decision support and

97
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,450
large scale analytics has really been

98
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,650
enabled by this combination of FHIR and OHDSI together.

99
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,980
So, it's a great time to be working on this,

100
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,220
and I think it's only going to grow in the years ahead.

101
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,550
Thanks very.
