00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Dr. Karen Bell is the chair of

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,405
the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology,

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:14,745
CCHIT, which is a not for profit HIT certification body with an educational mission.

4
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:19,759
In a June 2013 post on the Health Affairs blog,

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:22,080
Dr. Bell said that models such as

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,345
a ACOs must successfully implement seven business processes,

7
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:32,230
all of which rely heavily on the proper use of Health Informatics.

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,705
The seven processes are: care coordination, cohort management,

9
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:42,010
patient relationship management, clinician engagement,

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,815
financial management, reporting, and knowledge management.

11
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:53,980
To support this, she lists four primary requirements of an ACO HIT infrastructure.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,230
The first demands the ability to share health information between and

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,892
among various internal and external providers,

14
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:06,110
patients, and their designated caregivers.

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,180
Second, there needs to be data integration from clinical,

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,680
administrative, financial and patient derived sources.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,505
The third requires attention to HIT functions that support patient safety.

18
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:24,290
The fourth requires strong privacy and security protections.

19
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,450
Most health care organizations have a lot of work to do in order to achieve all of this.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,145
Earlier in her post,

21
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,400
Dr. Bell says that quote,

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,760
the promise of Accountable Care is tempered by a dearth of

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,645
experience with care process redesign and culture change,

24
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:45,710
and of knowledge about the health information technology infrastructure

25
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,680
necessary to optimally support healthcare transformation, end quote.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,295
To summarize, the need for health IT to support new care and payment models is clear,

27
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:03,329
but we still have a long way to go to develop and properly use those systems.

28
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,160
Next we turn to some of the key challenges to doing that.
