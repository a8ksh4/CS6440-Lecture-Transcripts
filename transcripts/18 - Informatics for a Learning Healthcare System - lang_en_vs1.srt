00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
As shown in this graphic,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,560
there are at least three key informatics challenges to

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,577
overcome in order to achieve a learning health care system.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:14,440
First, providers must adopt digital records.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,595
Second, no systems must be able to share data a characteristic called interoperability.

6
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:25,095
And third, that shared data must be aggregated,

7
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:29,905
analyzed, and presented in a clinically useful and timely manner.

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,125
Because of the federal government's high tech program,

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,290
that we'll discuss in the next lesson,

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,129
adoption is now a largely solved challenge.

11
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,770
Much of the excitement about fire rests on

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,600
its apparent ability to help overcome the interoperability challenge.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,990
Fire apps, offer the prospect of solving the problem of

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,010
timely and useful presentation of the results of the new knowledge

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,890
gleaned from analysis of past care to busy physicians.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,420
Here again, economics plays a key role.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,658
If providers have an incentive to get it right and do that efficiently,

18
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,855
then they'll be interested in creating a learning health care system,

19
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:13,206
because they can more clearly see how they benefit from it.

20
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,110
Well, now consider one example,

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,000
when to discharge a patient after surgery.
