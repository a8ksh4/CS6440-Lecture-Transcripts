00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
>>I'm John Sweeney. I'm the Joseph Brown Whitehead professor of surgery,

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:07,015
and chairman of the Department of Surgery for the Emory University School of Medicine.

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:11,810
Muscle Insertion and chief Emory health care.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,465
We became interested in this problem in about 2009- 2010,

5
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:19,490
and it was based on a landmark paper that was

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,525
published in New England Journal of Medicine in 2007.

7
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:26,870
In that paper the authors found that Medicare patients

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,910
discharged from the hospital we were readmitted an enormous number,

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,690
almost 20% of those patients.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,800
And within 30 days after discharge the cost

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,060
to the health care system was in the billions of dollars.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,565
And so, it was creating a significant amount of interest at the federal level.

13
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:50,060
And as part of the patient protection Affordable Care Act Section, 13:24,

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,020
which is the readmission Reduction Act was signed into law which

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,095
penalizes hospitals that have access readmission rates over what's expected.

16
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:04,040
And so, this has become a substantial problem and generated substantial focus for

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,900
hospitals around the country to reduce

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,310
their readmission rates and improve outcomes for their patients.

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,150
It's an interesting problem.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,180
As we started looking at the readmission problem,

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,850
we realized that there were several factors at

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,700
play that needed to be considered not just the simple readmission.

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,310
The first was the decision to send the patient home.

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,510
One was the patient ready to be discharged.

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,850
And keeping in mind with that that the longer patient stays in the hospital,

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,715
the higher the costs associated with that.

27
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:42,000
And so, our doctors are incentivized to reduce costs

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,650
and move patients through the hospital care segment.

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,125
If they move too quickly, patients could potentially be readmitted.

30
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,730
And so, we felt that the tool that brought information to

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,915
bear that help providers make timely decisions,

32
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,905
that were more effective and reduce

33
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:04,650
readmission rates really could make a huge difference in

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:12,503
the outcomes for patients but also decrease costs for health care system.

35
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:15,040
I am a practicing general surgeon.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,405
I do complex general surgery and so because my interest is in that area

37
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,620
and patients that undergo

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,490
complex general surgery can have readmission rates as high as 20%,

39
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,165
we initially focused on a large dataset of patients here at

40
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:32,649
Emory University Hospital that had previously undergone complex GI surgery.

41
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:36,100
And we looked at readmissions in those patients and with the help of

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,240
the economists working at Georgia State built a predictive model that

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,660
helped us with more likely

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,640
predicting one it was the appropriate time to send a patient home from the hospital.

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,910
We then took that tool into

46
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,155
the simulated setting and actually both using a computer simulation setting,

47
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:00,100
and also mock patient actors

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,900
in a simulation setting here in the Emory Center for experiential learning.

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,750
We actually showed that this tool does have benefit,

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,665
and we think that in the true clinical setting would lead to reduce readmissions,

51
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,258
decreased like this day,

52
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:17,265
and improve outcomes overall for our patients.

53
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:23,635
The big issue for us now is as we've put a considerable amount of work

54
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:26,620
into developing what we think is something that could

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,525
have some significant benefit at the bedside,

56
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,410
as how to be able to integrate an electronic record with

57
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,440
this decision support tool and really firers the mechanism for doing that.

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,330
It's the opportunity that's going to allow us to bring to bear what we've

59
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,250
spent a lot of time working on and what we

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,695
think is going to make a difference for patients.

61
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:54,178
And also, make the decision making process easier for provider.

62
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:58,720
The future of our tool I think is the next step,

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,380
is going to be a clinical trial with the tool and the clinical arena.

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,330
We've already shown the utility

65
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,465
both in the computer simulated setting as well as in a mock patient setting.

66
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:13,600
But in reality what needs to happen next is this tool needs to be

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,470
trialled in the clinical setting to demonstrate its utility.

68
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,270
The risks of readmission and the impacts of

69
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,390
a readmission as well as the impacts of a prolonged length of stay are significant.

70
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,250
And therefore, we think that this needs to be trialled in a

71
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,030
controlled setting before turn loose on the healthcare environment.
