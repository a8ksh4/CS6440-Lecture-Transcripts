1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Computer systems initially had limited capability,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,920
so commercial vendors focused on a specific hospital department,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,970
such as the laboratory or pharmacy.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,380
As the use of these departmentally specific systems grew,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,170
their inability to share data across vendors became problematic.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,040
This led to the formation of the non-profit standards setting organization,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,280
Health Level 7, and the development of

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,175
the first successful messaging standard for health data sharing.

9
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:39,665
This early standard was based on EDI X 12 technology for manufacturing in the 1980's.

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,360
You can see an example here,

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,580
and surprisingly, it's still in widespread use.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,780
Over time, a few large vendors emerged with systems designed to meet

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,700
most of the major computing needs of a hospital and its associated clinics.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,190
For reasons we will discuss later on,

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,650
meaningful clinical data sharing among these mega systems was problematic.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,780
And independent access to the data they stored was very.
