00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
In this lesson we will begin a discussion of

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,275
the key informatics tools needed to power a learning healthcare system.

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,940
These tools include electronic records for both providers and

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,655
patients as well as information sharing technologies to bind them together.

5
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:20,160
We will also discuss the challenges that we

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,620
still face in perfecting these systems to make

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,460
them both usable and useful in the real world of health care delivery.
