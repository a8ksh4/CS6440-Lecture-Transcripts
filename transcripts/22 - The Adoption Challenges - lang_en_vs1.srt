00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
In the previous lesson,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,450
we saw that most hospitals and around half of

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,410
all providers now use an electronic medical record or EMR system.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,660
It is easy to forget just how remarkable this is since as recently as

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,485
2008 only 4% of providers had what we now call a basic EMR system.

6
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:26,300
Perhaps even more surprisingly, in 2009,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,580
only 1.5% of non-federal hospitals had one.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,800
These statistics come from a pair of

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,145
important papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine,

10
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,575
generally regarded as the leading journal in the field.

11
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,650
I recommend you read them.

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,020
Federal hospitals who are excluded from the study,

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,500
largely because the Veterans Administration, the V.A.,

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,040
the nation's largest integrated health care system was

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,945
a pioneer and all of their hospitals had EMR as well before the study was done.

16
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:03,380
The V.A. has veterans information systems and technology architecture or Vista for short,

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,850
dates back to the 1980's and consists of nearly 180 applications for the VA's clinical,

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,955
financial, administrative, and infrastructure needs.

19
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:18,415
All integrated into a single common database.

20
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:21,000
Here is an example of Vista's capabilities,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,945
showing that images can be retrieved by any physician in the system,

22
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:29,190
no matter where in that huge system those images are stored.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,155
This capability is still not widely available elsewhere in U.S. healthcare.

24
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:37,315
So, in less than a decade,

25
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:42,940
we went from 4% of providers having a basic human system to around half.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,020
How did this transformation toward

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,285
a more interconnected system occur in less than a decade?

28
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:52,010
Many people including me long argued that

29
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,010
only federal intervention would make EMR adoption happen.

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,780
A core reason for this is once again, economics.

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,490
Without federal intervention, hospitals and providers would have to invest,

32
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,950
to go through a difficult, time consuming,

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,355
and often frustrating transition from paper to electronic records.

34
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:15,200
Moreover, under the pay for procedure reimbursement model,

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,150
to the extent the EMR led to a reduction in unnecessary or duplicative care,

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,385
it might negatively affect their revenue.

37
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:27,435
Moreover, EMR adoption is an example of network benefits.

38
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,640
The more providers that have them,

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,775
the more valuable they become because of data sharing.

40
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:37,200
In such a situation it is always hard to find enough early adopters,

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,510
willing to innovate in the hope of some future gain.
