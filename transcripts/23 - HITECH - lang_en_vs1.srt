1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
This economic impediment was the basis for

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,130
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,715
abbreviated Hi Tech, a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,400
commonly called the Stimulus.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,210
The details are complex,

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,810
but there were three basic elements of the program: First there was HIT certification,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,600
that defined minimum functional requirements for EHRs and other clinical tools.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,670
Second, there was meaningful use,

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,515
which defined the minimum use to which hospitals and providers must put their EHR.

10
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,470
Third, there were incentive payments made to

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,920
hospitals and providers for adopting a certified EHR,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,560
and meeting the requirements of meaningful use.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,110
These programs are of course interdependent,

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,705
and do not apply to all providers,

15
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:56,550
only hospitals and providers that participated in Medicare or Medicaid,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,040
adopted a certified EHR,

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,000
and used it according to the prescriptions in meaningful use were eligible to

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,850
receive incentive payments in 2011 through 2015.

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,175
Incentive payments came to hospitals and providers

20
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:15,580
through their participation in either Medicare or Medicaid.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,405
Providers could be eligible only for one,

22
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:21,565
but hospitals could be eligible for both.

23
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,310
There were annual limits to the amount of

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,740
the payments and the total amount that a provider

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,665
could earn depended on when that provider achieved the stages of meaningful use.

26
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:33,530
As of October 2015,

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,630
more than 479000 health care providers received incentive
