Before we move on,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,315
I need to clarify the difference between an electronic health record (or E.H.R.),

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:11,305
and an electronic medical record, or EMR.

4
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:14,210
EMRs, as the name implies,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,520
are usually the digital records of a patient as

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,940
recorded by one or more of their providers.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,580
Historically, that was the focus of electronic records.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,645
An electronic health record is a complete record of a patient's health.

9
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:32,755
Today with the advent of the Internet, mobile apps,

10
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:36,875
wearable measurement technologies, and even social networking,

11
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,150
a complete patient view requires interoperability,

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,220
so that all their records from all of

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,660
their providers are combined with data from these other sources.
