00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Meaningful use is a complex program in

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,210
three stages that coordinates with the approach to provider reimbursement for Medicare.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,860
We can only cover the main points here.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,800
The central goals of Meaningful Use are the use of

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,720
certified EHR technology in a clinically meaningful manner,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,280
such as e-prescribing, for electronic exchange of health information to improve

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,330
quality of health care and to submit clinical quality and other measures.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,180
The sub-goals for clinical care include: improving care coordination,

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,880
reducing health care disparities,

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,640
engaging patients and their families,

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,730
improving population and public health,

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,625
and ensuring adequate privacy and security.

13
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,620
Note that these goals align well with what experts

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,285
believe is needed to improve the management of chronic disease.

15
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:03,935
The developers of Meaningful Use were well aware of the mismatch we discussed in lesson

16
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:10,495
one between the focus of our healthcare system and the diseases that drive most costs.

17
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:16,300
This Meaningful Use timeline from the CDC shows that the program began in 2010,

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,910
and starting in 2015,

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,070
there were reductions in Medicare payments to

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,850
hospitals and providers that were not Meaningful Users.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,030
The timeline in stage 3,

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,060
in particular, is highly political.

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,600
Many argue that the pace of the program is too rapid given

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,820
the complexity of implementing and properly

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,350
integrating these systems into a health care organization.

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,560
The CDC generally does a good job of clearly explaining the program,

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,715
so I would recommend their site for updates.

28
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:52,000
Next, we'll turn to some of the challenges of EHRs and their adoption.
