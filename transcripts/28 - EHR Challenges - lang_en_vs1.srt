00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
In 2009, the National Academies of Science

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,235
published computational technology for effective health care,

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,115
immediate steps and strategic directions.

4
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:15,140
Dr. William Stead, the distinguished head of

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,210
Vanderbilt University's biomedical informatics department was the coeditor.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,145
The report states that quote,

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:30,085
"IT applications appear designed largely to automate tasks or business processes.

8
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:35,540
They're often designed in ways that simply mimic existing paper-based forms and provide

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,480
little support for the cognitive tasks of

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,305
clinicians or the workflow of the people who must actually use the system.

11
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:46,320
Moreover, these applications do not

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,620
take advantage of human-computer interaction principles,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,470
leading to poor designs that can increase the chance of error,

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,890
add to rather than reduce work,

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,165
and compound the frustrations of executing required tasks.

16
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:04,980
As a result, these applications sometimes increase workload,

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,510
and they can introduce new forms of error that are difficult to detect."

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,930
This seems to me to be congruent with the results of

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,375
the physician EHR surveys we just cited earlier.

20
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,785
It's also suggestive of the concerns I often hear from physicians,

21
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:26,758
that their EHR provides a one size fits all approach to charting,

22
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:31,285
that doesn't capture the nuances of actual patient care.

23
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:34,530
In fact, the most common approach to electronic charting is

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,310
a template which as the report I just quoted

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,180
suggests mimics existing paper forms and largely

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,420
ignores the potential of a computer to be adaptive to the clinical situation.

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,820
The report identified seven information intensive aspects of

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,320
the IOM's vision of

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,775
a learning health care system that current EHRs often failed to provide.

30
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:03,080
I've abbreviated them here for legibility.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,226
Comprehensive data on conditions, treatments and outcomes,

32
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:11,770
support to help providers and patients integrate

33
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,640
patient specific data where possible and account for any uncertainties that remain.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,230
Support to help providers integrate evidence based

35
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,290
practice guidelines and research results into daily practice.

36
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,540
Tools to help providers manage a portfolio of patients and to highlight

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,315
problems as they arrive both for an individual patient and within populations.

38
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:40,525
Rapid integration of new instrumentation,

39
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:44,375
biologic knowledge and treatment modalities.

40
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:49,580
A combination of growing heterogeneity of locales for care provision,

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,240
including home instrumentation for monitoring and treatment,

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,095
lifestyle integration and remote assistance.

43
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,500
An empowerment of patients and their families in

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,250
effective management of healthcare decisions and their implementation.

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,675
This is a list of what I would call clinical deficiencies.

46
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,300
Many are of increasing interest because of

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,875
the new care and payment models we've discussed.

48
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:19,265
However, most current EHRs date from the era of pay for

49
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:24,965
procedure and emphasize support of billing and administrative processes.

50
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:28,710
These are complex large scale systems.

51
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,905
They're expensive and because of high tech now widely installed.

52
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:36,760
How might we fix or even replace them.

53
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,480
Here's one promising approach.

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,645
FHIR apps crafted to meet the needs of providers caring for specific conditions.

55
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,570
Here's an example of that for the care of

56
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,990
arthritis developed by the Geisinger Health System,

57
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,705
widely regarded as one of the nation's highest performing health care organizations.

58
00:03:55,705 --> 00:04:00,290
Its user interface is specific to this condition and it can

59
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,410
display data recorded earlier by the patient, saving physician time.

60
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,610
Here's another approach.

61
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,420
The use of machine learning and specifically a neural network to enable the EHR

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,460
learn and adapt to the clinical approach used

63
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,180
by physicians to care for the problems they commonly see.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,450
As shown here, once it has been trained on

65
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,260
a problem when the physician next sees that problem the Praxis EHR

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,350
presents their likely note but has

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,340
enough clinical knowledge to recognize what data fields must be specified at each visit.

68
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,995
The company claims that once the system is trained it actually saves physician time.

69
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:47,355
The approach seems to work since physicians consistently give

70
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:52,005
Praxis some of their highest user satisfaction ratings.

71
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:57,335
For some insights into the roles EHR connected FIHR apps may play.

72
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:00,540
We will now interview Tate Gilchrist's senior business developer

73
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,000
for Open Platform Services at the Cerner Corp.
