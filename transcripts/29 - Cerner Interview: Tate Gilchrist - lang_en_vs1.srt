1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
>>Hi I'm Paula Braun. I'm an entrepreneur in

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,200
residence with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,325
>>Hi. I'm Tate Gilchrist.

4
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:12,255
I'm a senior business developer at Cerner Corporation out of Kansas City, Missouri.

5
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:16,470
>>Tate, could you give us a high level overview of Cerner's history and current business?

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,355
>>Sure, Sure. So, Cerner was started several decades ago

7
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,620
by three very visionary gentlemen

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,230
sitting at a picnic table in North Kansas City, Missouri.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,830
We've grown from that time in very humble roots into

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,080
a global healthcare information technology company in numerous countries the Middle East,

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,110
Australia, the UK, all over the United States,

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,240
Canada and we use a variety of

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,675
technologies to serve the healthcare systems that we support.

14
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,335
Cloud-based technologies such as SMART on FHIR,

15
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:49,080
population health cloud based technologies.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,290
Cerner's committed a substantial amount of money to R&D every year and we do this in

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,450
an effort to really drive the innovation for

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,525
that's going to be needed to support the health of patients across the globe.

19
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:06,360
>>Great. And Cerner was one of the first to support SMART as

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,000
a platform for allowing third party developers to contribute to your ecosystem.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,150
>>Yeah.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,140
>>Can you share some insight and why you did that?

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,365
>>Yeah, again and I think it comes back to, you know,

24
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,770
the three gentlemen that I spoke of our founders

25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,330
so very visionary individuals and they recognize that the way that we're currently

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,970
doing business and the way that the market is currently set

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,579
up is really not sustainable if we're going to achieve

28
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,870
the things that we want to achieve and so they

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,779
decided that we needed to pursue being an open platform company.

30
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,185
Taking the vast amounts of data that

31
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:47,190
our clients are generating and the patients are generating when they're

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,705
using our core EMR and through the use of APIs

33
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:54,660
to be able to open it up so that third party developers can come in with

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,150
these brilliant ideas that maybe we hadn't even

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,150
thought of or maybe we just hadn't gotten around to thinking

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,770
of yet and be going to take them and give them the tools to come in and take

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,620
their application and put it inside of our EMR so that

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,590
our providers and for the patients themselves can use too.

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,190
It's a very, very exciting time in our company's history and I'm very,

40
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,615
very happy to be a part of it.

41
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:23,190
>>Great. Now some have commented that SMART on FHIR is an academic exercise.

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,510
What's your take on that from your perspective at Cerner?

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,170
>>No longer an academic exercise, you know.

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,630
Cerner has been working with Argonaut group.

45
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,870
And others for several years now and SMART on FHIR.

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,270
And ah, it's, it's real now,

47
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,390
so we have some actual app usage.

48
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,570
We have numerous clients that have deployed the API,

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,730
that have built their own applications.

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,400
We have clients that have taken applications

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,250
from third party vendors that have used our tools,

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,740
that we have openly available to anyone,

53
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,020
even our competitors to be able to use

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,810
and have taken those applications and put them into

55
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,600
their production environments and were even started

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,785
seeing some early outcomes out of the use of those apps.

57
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:05,340
So while it's true,

58
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,650
it is very, very earl, we're very,

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,110
very excited about the progress that's been made and

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,230
the exponential growth curve is really starting to ramp up.

61
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,345
So we're very excited to see what the future will hold.

62
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:22,855
>>Surveys of physicians show that using electronic medical records can be inefficient.

63
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:26,410
What role do you think that apps can play in this?

64
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,874
>>Well, I think one of the great hopes with SMART on

65
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,955
FHIR app is that this is really an opportunity for us to

66
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,610
fully engage the physician in

67
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,230
the workflow process and in some cases in the app development process.

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,720
We've got numerous examples now of companies and of individuals that

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,750
have almost taken the classical example

70
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,750
of medicine so the bench to bedside approach, right?

71
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,000
A drug or device would have to go through a clinical vetting process, a study, etc.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,005
Healthcare Information Technology is typically not that way but with SMART on FHIR,

73
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:06,225
we can have innovative developers and innovative individuals that can take

74
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,030
clinically vetted content that is specific to

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,390
the physician and can now take that and put that in the physician's workflow.

76
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,845
The hope is that, by using that,

77
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,420
that would advance patient care,

78
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,860
increase physician satisfaction and a rising tide is going to lift all boats.

79
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,750
>>Cerner has also announced that it will be supporting CDS Hooks.

80
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,270
How do you think that that will help with

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,860
the further adoption of clinical decision support tools?

82
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,100
>>Well, CDS Hooks is very,

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,370
very exciting and we have a numerous number of developers that are

84
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,940
anxiously awaiting our ability to be able to deploy it for their use.

85
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,720
From a broad concept, you know,

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,765
a provider doesn't want to have to do another click to invoke an app.

87
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,960
With CDS Hooks, the hope is not only will in

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,995
response to say a clinical event or an open chart or something of that nature,

89
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,500
that a SMART app workflow can be kicked off.

90
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,690
But the notion of having CDS Hooks available as a tool for

91
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,830
a developer will pull in all of these CDS specific content,

92
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,230
companies that can create innovative apps,

93
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,850
lift patient care, and produce superior outcomes.

94
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,685
>>Where do you feel that EHR's with an app platform will take us in the coming years?

95
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,060
>>Well, that's a pretty big question.

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,660
I mean, I think that we know we've made great progress but if we

97
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,290
are truly to look at the promise of FHIR and the use of

98
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,310
open standards and the notion of the EMR as

99
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,930
essentially on a platform much like an iPhone or Android device.

100
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,032
The possibilities really if you think about them are endless,

101
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,625
but if I'm really to see,

102
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,790
to see into the future and see what I think that

103
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,825
potentially could be the grand vision of things.

104
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:56,870
The notion of the patient having access to their own data to be able to try

105
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,805
these multitude of consumer apps that these

106
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:03,110
thousands of consumer apps that are out there for chronic care,

107
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,152
whether it's diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.,

108
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:09,530
we need FHIR and we need a robust ecosystem and

109
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,460
a platform to be able to allow developers to be able to build that.

110
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,490
Secondly, the notion of being able to feed data to

111
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,130
the research community so the notion of FHIR bundles being able to push data out.

112
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,540
So, in that situation,

113
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,180
you're not looking at FHIR as merely a tool to

114
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,270
live in operability but to really lift medicine,

115
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,730
as a whole, and drive the health of patients and really human beings in general forward.

116
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,040
>>Thank you so much.

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,660
>>Thank-
