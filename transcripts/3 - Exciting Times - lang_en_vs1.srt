1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Today, all that is changing rapidly as the number

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,825
of health related open APIs and web tools explodes.

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:11,520
Of these, the most important is

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,945
fast health care interoperability resources or FHIR spelled

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:20,560
F-H-I-R. FHIR is a new standard based on

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,955
contemporary technologies and it's achieving dramatic acceptance and adoption.

7
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:31,460
FHIR offers the promise of open access to clinical data,

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,170
with the right permissions of course.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,864
As you can see from these examples,

10
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:41,105
it is even turning electronic medical records systems into open app platforms,

11
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:44,245
similar to the smartphone in your pocket.

12
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,877
This is the first university level course based upon FHIR.

13
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:53,010
As we proceed, you will literally be working to help solve

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,450
real world health care challenges using the health informatics approaches of the future.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,180
We'll now travel to Emory Health Systems,

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,000
EICU to look at an example of that from an earlier iteration of the course.
