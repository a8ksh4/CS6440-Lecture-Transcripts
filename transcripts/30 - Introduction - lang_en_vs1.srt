00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,315
Patient facing health informatics tools is a rich and increasingly interesting field

2
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,180
particularly because of the growing use of apps and

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,590
mobile devices for patients to report on and measure their behavior,

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,000
activity, and physiologic parameters.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,795
Those new technologies even have a name, mHealth.

6
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,495
It will be the topic of a later lesson.

7
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:26,340
In this one, we will address some of the other tools

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,760
and approaches to patient engagement through informatics.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,585
Some are old ideas while others are quite new.

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:37,530
The changing economics and care models in healthcare are increasing interest

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,000
in all of them.
