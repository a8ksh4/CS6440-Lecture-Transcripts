1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,135
Should patients be the aggregation point for all their health data?

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:10,195
Should they contribute data they have documented or recorded using devices and apps?

3
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:13,230
Should they have access to their physicians notes,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,560
and even the ability to suggest corrections?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,140
Will their use of personal technologies engage them and lead to better outcomes?

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,580
These are some of the key questions,

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,740
and potential benefits that arise from the concept of a personal health record, or PHR.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,595
The term first appeared in a 1978 paper,

9
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:38,110
but it was really not practical until around

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,815
2000 with the dramatic decline in the cost of computing,

11
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:45,000
and the increasing availability of the Internet.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,350
Of course the almost universal use of

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,775
smartphones provides a near ideal ubiquitous PHR platform.

14
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:56,895
The original idea was a patient maintained record,

15
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:02,920
but you can see from these questions it's scope is expanding in our connected world.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,610
Today the Markle Foundation's Connecting for Health initiative

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,475
defines a personal health record as quote,

18
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:14,170
an electronic application through which individuals can access, manage,

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,360
and share their health information,

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,225
and that of others for whom they are authorized.

21
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,815
In a private, secure,

22
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,130
and confidential environment, end quote.
