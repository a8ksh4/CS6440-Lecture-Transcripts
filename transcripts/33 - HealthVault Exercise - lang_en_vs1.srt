1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
We will use Microsoft's HealthVault PHR because it is free, public,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,010
and does a good job of demonstrating some key PHR concepts, capabilities, and challenges.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,300
Here you can see that HealthVault records

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,290
the common health information patients say they want to keep track of.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,615
It can also upload data from numerous personal devices and apps.

6
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:30,040
Finally, it provides for uploading health information from a patient's providers.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,260
HealthVault displays the patient's health record in tiles.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,465
Each user can decide which ones they want on their personal health dashboard.

9
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:45,765
Here you can see two menu items we will be using, documents and sharing.

10
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,500
I've expanded the documents menu.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,730
Notes support for continuity of care documents, or CCDs,

12
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,240
along with older formats such as the CCR,

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,535
a predecessor to the CCD,

14
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:03,077
and even files from spreadsheets or word processing software.

15
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:06,170
Patients can also upload images.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,780
Note that this patient has six CCDs,

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,860
which could have come from six different providers caring for their various problems.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,620
We will discuss CCDs in more detail later but as I mentioned earlier they are

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,250
pre-FHIR HL7 standard for an XML formatted patient summary.

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,540
The Meaningful Use Stage 2 objectives for care coordination and

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,870
patient engagement require the latest HL7 document standard, called CCDA.

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,340
So all states to certify EHRs can produce CCA documents.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,890
CCDs are a specific template within

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,845
the CCDA standard that is ideal for loading data into our personal health record.

25
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:55,490
Any software that supports the standard, as HealthVault does,

26
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,390
can upload and should generally be able to correctly store data

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,185
from CCDs created by the patients providers EHR.

28
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:09,495
HealthVault does this when patients push the add items button.

29
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:12,300
I've highlighted one of the CCDs listed and then

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,835
clicked on the dot dot dot link to bring up a menu.

31
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:21,770
Importantly, most browsers will render XML documents in reasonably human readable form.

32
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,000
Here you see the CCD I had highlighted after I

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,865
clicked on The View details link in the menu we just looked at.

34
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,745
I think you'll agree that it is quite readable.

35
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:40,670
The CCD file CS 6440 sample CCD is available to you on the course site.

36
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,340
Your exercise is to first create and

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,205
HealthVault account and then upload this CCD into it.

38
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,310
Once you have done that,

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,820
click the Add items box next to its name in the list of CCD documents to experience what

40
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,850
an actual patient would need to do in order to

41
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,285
decide what data from their record to load into their PHR.

42
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:07,090
Next, click on the sharing item in

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,690
the HealthVault menu we discussed a moment ago to bring up this screen.

44
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,980
Note at the top that patients can invite someone,

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,360
such as family members,

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,630
to share their data.

47
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,255
Those invitees receive an email invitation like this one.

48
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:29,810
Be sure to click on share only the types of information selected below.

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,550
Since patients express concern about privacy,

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,230
they might well want to choose what information they wish to share.

51
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,860
Spend a few minutes looking at the choices and I think you will quickly appreciate why

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,460
understanding medical terminology is one of the challenges patients face in using a PHR.

53
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:57,455
Now spend some time exploring the various sharing options offered on this page.

54
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you agree that computer literacy might also be a barrier to some patients using a PHR?

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,755
Finally, do you think there might be an even easier,

56
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:11,740
more usable way for patients to express these preferences and choices?

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,995
If you own a device, or use an app,

58
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,690
that can record health data,

59
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,525
I suggest you try to upload data from it to HealthVault.

60
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:25,290
As you can see here, there's an extensive list of supported apps and devices.
