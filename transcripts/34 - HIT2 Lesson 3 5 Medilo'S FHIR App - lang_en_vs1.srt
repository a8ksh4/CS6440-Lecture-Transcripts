00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
Might a fire enabled ecosystem of EHRs make all of this much easier for patients?

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,770
At a recent HL7 fire applications roundtable meeting at Duke University,

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,905
several vendors presented firebase solutions

4
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,810
for patients to aggregate data from all their providers.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,320
Medley I was one of the new companies that presented at Duke.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,130
To use their app, patients must first identify their providers.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,260
To facilitate this, the app links to

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,265
a directory containing 4.2 million provider profiles.

9
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,615
To make searching easier,

10
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:40,395
patients are defaulted to their current location,

11
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:42,565
but they can search anywhere.

12
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:45,205
Having selected a provider,

13
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:50,550
patients can choose what data and date range they want to load into their app.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,760
They then log on using their credentials for the chosen provider's patient portal.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,400
One arm of the Medley O app seeks to create a meaningful medication list using

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,900
fire medication order resources from only the providers who wrote the prescription.

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,540
However, as you can see here,

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,150
every new refill for a prescription creates

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,920
a new fire medication order resource that makes us a long list.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,255
A company's solution is to reconcile the orders using the RX norm CUI

21
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:29,680
number: a six digit numeric code that very specifically represents medications.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,500
We will look at RX norm later.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,125
They then group the orders based on this six digit number so the list,

24
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,400
as you see here,

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,525
contains each medication only once.

26
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,470
Patients can see each prescription,

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,140
the dates, and the prescribing physicians.
