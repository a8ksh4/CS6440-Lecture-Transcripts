1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,275
Care evolution also presented a PHR at the Dubfire applications round table.

2
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:08,405
The company says that it provides

3
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:12,675
secure interoperability solutions for population health management,

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,600
care coordination and consumer engagement.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,760
Its myFHR, family health record app,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,329
runs on the web and in iOS devices and leverages fire to enable consumers to

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,680
aggregate and manage their health data from

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,284
multiple hospital or physician office portals.

9
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:35,020
Consumers can view and manage their medications,

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,195
allergies and lab results.

11
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:41,550
The app also supports wearable sensors and connected devices,

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,920
such as glucometers, weight scales,

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,870
and blood pressure monitors,

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,200
provides notifications for upcoming appointments,

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,895
overdue preventive screenings and immunizations, and drug-drug interactions.

16
00:00:54,895 --> 00:01:01,020
We will now see a video demonstration of myFHR provided for this course by the company.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,610
Before we watch that video,

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,470
I would like to provide a personal note.

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,884
While I was still in training,

20
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:09,680
I cared for a patient who eventually died because he was

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,070
taking two simultaneous prescriptions for prednisone,

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,690
the steroid medication mentioned in the video.

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,000
A tool like myFHR might well have prevented that tragedy from occurring.
