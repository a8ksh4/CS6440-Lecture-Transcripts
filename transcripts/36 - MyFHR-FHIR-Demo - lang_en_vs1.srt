1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,990
So at this point we're starting with Mary,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,570
who has already established an account and logged in.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,590
You notice she gave herself some patient notes and

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,855
she also has uploaded a report that includes a diagnostic X-ray.

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,540
For this demo, we're going to show off some of

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,705
the fire connection capabilities of My FHIR.

7
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:26,915
So we're going to go over to the Settings tab and click on Add a provider data source.

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,260
This list shows all the available provider data sources.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,055
You can also search by state, zip code,

10
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:40,245
name or anything else like that.

11
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:45,120
In this case, we're going to connect to Epic.

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,340
In this case, we're going to allow access and that will take us back to My FHIR app.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,220
In the app, in this case,

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,860
we need to associate the Mary A account from

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,195
Epic to the Mary A account that My FHIR knows about.

16
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:15,180
This only happens if not all of

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,747
the identifying fields can be lined up between the patients,

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:25,620
that as My FHIR sees it and as the provider sees it.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,620
So now, you can see we have a connection to Epic sandbox as a data provider.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,810
And right now, the the app is going out and downloading

21
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,400
Mary's information from Epic and loading it into the system.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,710
And as you can see, when we refresh this,

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,980
the date has been downloaded a few seconds ago.

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,500
If we go back to Mary's profile,

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,560
we can see she now has medications.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,480
If we click into the medication list,

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,325
we can see everything that my FHIR is aware of and in this case,

28
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:00,500
all of it came from that Epic connection.

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,390
Going back to the setting screen,

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,955
we're going to connect to another data source.

31
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:13,960
In this case, it'll be CareEvolution's provider data source.

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,650
CareEvolution provides a screen that allows the user to

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,980
select the patient from all the patients that they have access to.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,860
If CareEvolution's provider allowed Mary to see her children,

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,949
or her parents, or her spouse,

36
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,510
they would also be listed in this list right here.

37
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,305
And depending on who she's trying to log in as,

38
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,420
and whose data she's trying to download,

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,150
she would select them from the list.

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,315
In this case, she'll just select herself and you'll see that the CareEvolution FHIR and

41
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:07,845
provider is added to the list of data sources and we fetched data.

42
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,940
Now when we look at the medications,

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,335
we see a combined list from both data sources.

44
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,995
In this case, it's quite a bit longer.

45
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,530
You can also see,

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,190
that we've called out that not all of your providers know about all of

47
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,100
your medications and we can drill into that to see exactly what it means.

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,775
On the summary screen,

49
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:31,510
you'll see that all the providers know about

50
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,900
these four medications and only some providers know about these four medications.

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,643
But since only two of them are currently active,

52
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,980
we're only going to focus on those.

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,635
So you can see CareEvolution is unaware of this one and Epic is unaware of this one.

54
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:52,230
If you wanted to, you could drill down and

55
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,020
take the perspective of one of these two providers.

56
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,400
In this case, let's say we have an appointment at the Epic provider.

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,040
Now, when talking to the doctor or nurse during your appointment,

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,650
you can say that you're not aware that I am

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,440
taking Prednisone and that's coming from CareEvolution.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:21,800
So they can add that to the list and be aware of everything that you're actually taking.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,965
Now, let's add one more data source.

62
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:30,550
In this case, we're going to connect to the Cedar-Sinai test box.

63
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,655
Cedar-Sinai is actually running a higher end point in production

64
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:39,745
and patients that go to Cedars-Sinai as one of their providers,

65
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:46,820
will have a log in to production and be able to pull their data into the My FHIR app.

66
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,360
Since Cedar-Sinai uses Epic,

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,740
the screen should look familiar.

68
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,650
It looks exactly like the Epic sandbox.

69
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,960
And after everything has been established,

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,710
you'll see Cedar-Sinai has been added to the list and is currently

71
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,131
waiting for its first update.

72
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:27,393
And now we fetched data.

73
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,950
So again, if we go back to the profile,

74
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
we'll see there's a couple of extra things in

75
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,525
here that we were able to pull from Cedar-Sinai,

76
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:40,190
including immunizations and allergies.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,175
We can also see that the medication list has grown in this case, by quite a bit.

78
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:54,655
If we wanted to, we could provide a little extra detail here by changing the view.

79
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:58,684
And now, we can see who the prescriber is,

80
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:03,580
what the medication class is and where each of these pieces of data came from.

81
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,145
So you can see there's quite a bit of varying data from Cedar-Sinai.

82
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:16,120
In this case, we can see that Lisinopril is known by all three providers but

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:28,090
only Cedar-Sinai knows about this one.

84
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,375
We also have a feature where if we know about all medications Mary is taking,

85
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,975
we can notify the user about things like drug-drug interactions.

86
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,525
So in this particular case,

87
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:44,210
we can see that there is an interaction between an SSRI and an NSAID.

88
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,675
And because we know that that's an important interaction and that

89
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:51,467
Mary should be aware that it could cause intestinal bleeding,

90
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:57,880
she should probably talk to her doctors and do something about it.

91
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,920
We can also allow Mary to edit this medication list.

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,465
And say for instance,

93
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:10,155
she's not actually taking this Potassium Chloride.

94
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,750
When she updates the list,

95
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,395
Potassium chloride will be added to the bottom in her inactive.

96
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:22,845
She can also choose to add medications that none of her providers know about.

97
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:32,885
For instance, she can say that she takes Melatonin to help her sleep.

98
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:37,120
And now, Melatonin has been added to the list.
