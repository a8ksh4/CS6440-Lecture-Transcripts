1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
As an alternative to any of these approaches for

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,375
giving patients the data from their AHR records,

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:10,130
why not give them direct access to those records?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,660
Dr. Schenck and Warner first proposed

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,605
this radical idea in the 1973 New England Journal of Medicine.

6
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:23,145
In 2010, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston,

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:26,145
Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania,

8
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,560
and Seattle's Harborview Medical Center,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,380
launched an exploratory study of the idea,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,630
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,110
Primary care doctors invited their patients to

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,765
read their notes via secure online portals.

13
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,425
The results were published in 2012,

14
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:48,940
in the prestigious journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,035
According to this effort, now called OpenNotes,

16
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,030
the big takeaways were,

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,710
doctors reported little change in their workload.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,740
Patients overwhelmingly approve of note sharing.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,715
Few patients are worried or confused by their notes.

20
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:10,500
Today five million patients have access to OpenNotes.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,650
You can visit https://www.opennotes.org for more information.

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,125
But we will now watch two videos provided by OpenNotes.

23
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,080
The first, shows how patients report reading

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,545
their notes helps them feel more in control of their health and health care.

25
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,470
This second video provides evidence that patients can

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,000
provide quality control from their own notes.
