1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,185
Even if we're having a discussion between sort of patient and doctor,

2
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,790
and the person seems to fully understand everything,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,310
then the family or patient can walk away and 10 minutes later we'll have a discussion.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,500
We'll say, did they say this or did they say that?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,510
Like, there's big amnesia.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,910
I forget what was said about the medication.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,345
I can go back and see what medication,

8
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:25,780
and what the dosages and all the things that I'm supposed

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,200
to know are all recorded in that note.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,964
Having it written down,

11
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:36,815
it's almost like there's another person telling you to take your meds.

12
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:41,410
I almost think of OpenNotes as closing the loop for me in many ways in that,

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,925
I meet face to face with the patient we have a conversation, I document it,

14
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,575
then I picture her going home and reading it later.

15
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:50,995
So it does feel like it extends the visit,

16
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:55,000
enhances the relationship, really sort of cements it in many ways.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,980
It's actually allowed me to be more present in my visits,

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,500
perhaps ask some more thoughtful questions in

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,755
a moment because I know that that note is coming.

20
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:09,445
It's not just the conversation that we have for two minutes but they

21
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:14,330
have a document to back it up and to come back and to clarify themselves.

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,150
The second session that we had,

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,270
she said to me,

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,175
what do you think about the idea of putting our therapy notes into PatientSite?

25
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,540
I said, oh my God, I love that. She goes, why?

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,425
I go, because in my world I forget.

27
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,760
For me I go back to my open notes all the time.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,730
My husband is very hard of hearing and so you can imagine, I mean,

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,910
even with perfect hearing I miss what doctors say sometimes,

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:55,900
and he's really lost so it's been a godsend that I can find out what the doctor told him.
