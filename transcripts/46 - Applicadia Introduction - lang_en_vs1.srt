1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Earlier, we discussed some innovative approaches to physician charting.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,995
Now that we have discussed semantic interoperability,

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,365
you can better appreciate the approach to

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:14,940
EHR documentation that Applicadia has developed.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,400
Richard Esmond, the company's chief technical

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,955
officer and co-chair of the CIMI work group,

7
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:24,190
has prepared a short video for this course.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,420
In it, you will see what he calls a graph

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,063
that is always focused around a clinical concept node

10
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:38,495
and presents the relationships it has to any other concept nodes known to the platform.

11
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,885
The node at the focus could be from SNOMED, ICD,

12
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,929
LOINC or RxNorm, some of the health data standards,

13
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,640
we will discuss in the next lesson.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,814
It also might be a synthetic knowledge element that the company has parsed

15
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:58,180
or analytically computed and then attached to that node through a relationship.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,110
Finally, a small but growing number of nodes are derived

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,535
from the clinical knowledge artifacts in CIMI models.

18
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,185
The video, though short,

19
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:14,060
is very rich conceptually and illustrates a number of interesting possibilities.

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,250
The use of voice recognition for medical documentation.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,640
The use of an NLP to properly place voice narration into the traditional sections of

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,580
a medical note and even the proper body system area of the review of systems,

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,765
a key part of a medical note.

24
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:35,800
Automatic encoding of free text notes into

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,795
complex data standards such as SNOMED and ICD-10.

26
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:48,775
The further use of NLP to properly map voice narrative to the clinical concept graphs,

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,140
thus, creating a basis for semantic interoperability.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,395
The use of a concept graph to guide the physician to properly

29
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:02,985
code into the very clinically detailed ICD-10 system.

30
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:06,450
The discussion of the history of present illness part of the note

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,750
concerning the patient's knee problem, illustrates this.

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,620
Similarly, this use of a concept graph could help the physician properly report

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,185
quality metrics or to remind them to provide

34
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:24,135
important but missing clinical details for a concept they've identified.

35
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:29,820
I urge you to study the video carefully using this list of capabilities.
