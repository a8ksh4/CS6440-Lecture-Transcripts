1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,985
The patient appears Anemic and pale, period.

2
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:10,670
Patient's heart rate is 98 and blood pressure is 120/80, period.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,665
Go to history of the present illness.

4
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:17,590
The patient presents with severe pain and swelling in

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,891
the left knee due to micro-tears in the patella tendon, period.

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,030
And just to show you a little bit about what's going on the background.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,920
So, we're taking the statement and running it through

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,055
computational linguistics to extract out all the key data points.

9
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,680
Then we have mapped that to an in-memory graph.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,020
The graph contains a hybrid of

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,630
20 different clinical ontologies that we

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,055
have woven together and then made it computable and processable.

13
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:44,670
And that's actually how we perform all of

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,645
our clinical decision support matching to clinical models.

15
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:55,465
Because at the end of the day, we're not saving the statement in the medical record.

16
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:59,770
We're saving the IDs using FHIR. So, clear this out.

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,475
Because that allows us to do things like ICD 10 coding.

18
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,750
So, this is not enough specificity to come up with

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,140
a fully refined ICD 10 building code. So, we're going to prompt.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,700
Only swelling. It's traumatic.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
And this is the initial count.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,366
So, here's all our ICD 10 codes.

23
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,820
Here is the structures that we are going to be

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,650
saving using FHIR into the electronic medical record.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,580
And over here on the left, this is the statement that

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,380
we're going to throw away. I'll do a few more.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:41,158
Acetaminophen, 500 mg. Twice a day for two weeks with food as needed for pain, period.

28
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:46,813
The patient needs a bilateral mammography, period.

29
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,160
Now, as you noticed,

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,430
we're actually determining where in the medical record that each bit of

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,228
information goes based on the information that we extract out from it.

32
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,270
Go to review of systems.

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,980
The patient's breath sounds a normal, period.

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:10,487
The patient's heart sounds are normal, period.

35
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:13,240
So here, it's determining body system,

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,345
again, by the information that we extract out of the statement.

37
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:22,447
The patient's grandmother died of lung cancer 10 years ago, period.

38
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:30,286
The patient had an appendectomy four years ago, period.

39
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,790
So here, this is going in

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,290
the medical record for this patient but it's

41
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,240
going in as information about their grandmother.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,555
In other words, the patient isn't dead the grandmother is dead.

43
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:43,365
Effectively, once you have information about each statement,

44
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,680
so many things about the capture of clinical information can be automated,

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,305
including clinical decision support in real time,

46
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:53,010
in figuring out where to place things in a medical record.

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,170
At the end of the day, the goal is to put

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,300
the clinicians attention back on

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,440
the patient and away from having to serve the needs of the system.

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Anyway, thanks for watching this demo.
