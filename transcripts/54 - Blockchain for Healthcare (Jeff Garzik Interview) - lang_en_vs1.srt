1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,250
Sure, thanks. And I'm glad to be here.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,155
I really got involved in open source Linux blockchain,

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,181
all of these technologies,

4
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,055
all of that, got my start at Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:32,070
I enjoyed just surfing what was then

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,330
the new internet back in the days of Mosaic 1.0 and before JavaScript,

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,025
before mobile apps, before animated web sites.

8
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:48,147
It was just basic HTML 1.0 and graphics that load really slowly.

9
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:54,660
And that was the atmosphere that I was raised in at Georgia Tech.

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,526
The dorms had just been wired for ethernet,

11
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,460
which was incredibly exciting.

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,545
We didn't have to do the slow dial up to connect to Hydra,

13
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:10,245
the multi CPU computer at the time the Acme Cluster replaced.

14
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,870
And it was an exciting time.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,550
That was ethernet, that was the internet and that was open source.

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,315
You could, for the first time,

17
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:24,050
download software that was not proprietary,

18
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,760
that you could really open up the guts of and explore as much as you wanted.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,515
And so after all my classes were done each day at Tech,

20
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,700
I would go to my dorm.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,645
I was admittedly, did not see the sun often at times.

22
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:46,490
I spent a lot of time in front of the computer and I was downloading Linux.

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,735
I was downloading the GNOME Project.

24
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,240
All of these were the early precursors to what

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,170
you see today in Linux data centers and Android,

26
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,936
user interfaces et cetera.

27
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:06,765
So that self-exploration is what led me to open source.

28
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:10,620
I started with Linux 0.99

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,795
back when Linus Torvalds was still at the University of Helsinki.

30
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:19,490
Linus, a couple of years before,

31
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,460
in 92 which was my first year at Tech.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,565
Linus had just posted the very first version of Linux and he said,

33
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,515
hey I've got my own version of Unix.

34
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,310
It's kind of like Minix.

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,970
Why don't you try it and download it?

36
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,020
And that kick started an open source revolution.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:46,225
I came into that about a year or two after the initial Linux versions were downloaded.

38
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:52,400
It was amazing to not just receive a bunch of floppy disks,

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,605
which were at the time how you delivered software and load that into your computer,

40
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,115
you had no source code.

41
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:03,095
It booted up Microsoft DOS or MS Windows 3.1.

42
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:07,880
And that was it. Open source just blew all that to smithereens.

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,405
You could as a software engineer,

44
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,365
open up the car hood,

45
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:20,670
look inside, understand why it works how it works and then change it.

46
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,025
And the beauty of software and this is why I'm not a mechanical engineer,

47
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:29,715
this is why I am a computer scientist, is that you can change something,

48
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:35,895
press a button that says test, and if it explodes, which it usually does on the first try,

49
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:41,390
You can go back reset to the beginning and try another tweak and do it again.

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,075
That's what I love about software.

51
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:48,620
That rapid iteration process allows you to develop so much more rapid.

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,090
And so that open source process led me to Linux and

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,590
the open nature of open source meant that this university student could create a patch,

54
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,310
a software change, post it on a mailing list and have

55
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,480
a bunch of other professional software developers critique it,

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,435
provide feedback and ultimately integrate that change,

57
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:16,455
my change as a university student,

58
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,950
into this operating system that everyone uses worldwide.

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,585
And that really gives you frankly a little bit of an ego boost.

60
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:30,665
It gives you, makes you feel good that your change was accepted, reviewed,

61
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:34,990
welcomed and that peer review process

62
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,245
helps the community adjust to risk and avoid errors.

63
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:44,790
So that was my journey from the open source that I was coding in my dorm room

64
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:52,350
led me to Linux and my contributions to Linux as it's the ideal,

65
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,865
sort of meritocracy environment,

66
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,705
the Linux environment as you contribute more

67
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:04,890
you are trusted more and you learn more and you gain more experience.

68
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,810
And so it's a positive feedback loop whereby as

69
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,430
the years went by I became a better and better Linux developer.

70
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,930
I understood more and more about the hardware process.

71
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,260
I had taken Jim Greenlee's assembly language class

72
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,575
at the College of Computing where I learned MIPS assembly language.

73
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,185
But it was the Linux kernel that really taught me why you do what you do.

74
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:32,205
Why CPUs are architected as they're architected.

75
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:40,740
And so that open source process feeds back into other developers as well.

76
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,510
I was able to share that knowledge,

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,210
not only with other Georgia Tech students but

78
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,900
with other people in the community and you wind up mentoring,

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,105
spreading the knowledge and that led to a career at Red Hat.

80
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:56,010
Red Hat saw what I had been building,

81
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,150
contributing and they said, "Hey,

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,975
do you want to come work for us and build Linux professionally?"

83
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:09,900
So that Linux, that Linux experience which started in the dorm room,

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,430
started with volunteer self-motivated development eventually led to

85
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,050
an over 10-year career and that contribution to open source,

86
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,985
that experience in open source,

87
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:26,040
also sort of led me to where I am today which is in the blockchain industry,

88
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:42,575
which is another open source technology as well.

89
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:49,165
That's right. Late in my Red Hat career, circa 2010,

90
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:56,540
I was browsing what was a popular web site at the time, slash.org moniker news for

91
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,880
nerds and just basically everyone in the tech community at the time.

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,100
Definitely read that website.

93
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,580
It talked about a decentralized digital currency which was

94
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,640
open source and I had experience in distributed computing at the time,

95
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,505
and I had been a skeptic.

96
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:16,539
I thought to myself,

97
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,815
there's no way this can work.

98
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:21,680
You've got to have a central cluster of computers.

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,930
A central management system of some sort and I was happy to be proven wrong.

100
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,220
I looked at this open source technology and because it was open source,

101
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,950
you can open up the hood inspect the technology gain your own trust in that technology.

102
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,250
And that was my journey from Linux to blockchain,

103
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,325
was that there was a new exciting innovative open source project

104
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:52,040
which it disrupts the existing business flows,

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,435
it breaks new boundaries,

106
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:58,035
it creates new trust avenues.

107
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,515
And that was very, very exciting.

108
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:06,425
And so just like 15 years before in my Linux career, it was open source.

109
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,510
I was self-motivated.

110
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,405
I download the source code,

111
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:13,025
saw some changes that ought to be made.

112
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,365
I thought in my humble opinion.

113
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:16,610
So I made those changes,

114
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,840
submitted those to the then leader of the project Satoshi Nakamoto,

115
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,315
a pseudonym nobody, mysterious figure,

116
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:29,115
nobody knows who he really is and he accepted those changes.

117
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:34,250
So it was just like my first foray into Linux when Linus Torvalds,

118
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,555
the leader of Linux accepted my first patch to the Linux kernel.

119
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,310
It was humbling. It was rewarding.

120
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:48,560
It was very exciting and it was clearly the cusp of what we now see as

121
00:08:48,560 --> 00:09:03,063
an entire industry, the blockchain industry.

122
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:09,815
Well, that's the question of the hour and more difficult to answer than you might imagine.

123
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:15,080
Blockchain is at once a database technology.

124
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,365
It's a technology that has a secure log of changes to a ledger.

125
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:28,390
It's a distributed network distributes those changes in that database,

126
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,355
that ledger to multiple nodes in a computer network,

127
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:39,610
all of which are cross checking each other to make sure that that ledger,

128
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,150
that database retains its integrity.

129
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,820
And so this is a very resilient technology, blockchain technology.

130
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,965
If you have a some of those nodes in the network are

131
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:56,410
malfunctioning then the network is resilient,

132
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,190
it automatically detects and routes around those changes.

133
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:09,035
And for this reason, it's essentially a reduced trust, very secure database network.

134
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:14,720
And the reason why that's interesting is that you can use it to deploy

135
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,411
some types of business cases and scenarios which benefit from that reduced trust.

136
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:26,335
The first use case being bitcoin which is

137
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:33,095
entirely dependent upon all of the nodes in this computer network.

138
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:39,100
Arriving at the same answer that Jeff has certain amount of digital currency,

139
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:47,325
say 100 units of bitcoin and Jeff transfers these to Bob, say 50 units of bitcoin,

140
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:52,570
this distributed ledger updates my balance

141
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,040
from 100 to 50 and Bob's balance from zero to 50.

142
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,280
Now we can obviously accomplish this with

143
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,070
a centralized database fairly easily and that's what banks do today.

144
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,110
The innovation in blockchain is that you don't necessarily

145
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,830
have to have a centralized authority to execute highly secure database updates.

146
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,760
In this particular case, currency.

147
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,874
The security of a currency is reliant upon this highly secure technology.

148
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:33,095
And so without that extremely high level of security,

149
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:39,890
you would not be able to reduce the level of trust required to use the system.

150
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,410
And so this has various cross-border,

151
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,555
cross company, cross organization,

152
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:53,075
cross business unit type of advantages whereby blockchain is more secure,

153
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:59,590
therefore you can create connections that can otherwise not be

154
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,920
connected. Well, there's really a lot of potential I think for blockchain in

155
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,550
health care but it is very, very early days.

156
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,050
As we like to say, the software has a lot of rough edges right now.

157
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,270
And so just pragmatically as a business person to a customer,

158
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,690
I would say that the roll-out is going to take several years,

159
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,728
but the potential is that it's worth it.

160
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:44,790
The potential is, is that we can have a more secure provider licensing,

161
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,595
more secure medical records,

162
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:52,950
we can utilize associated technologies such as digital identity,

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:00,080
smart contracts, and encryption to really put the patient in control of their own data.

164
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,630
We call that self-sovereign data where you are in control of

165
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:13,410
your data as a first principle and you permission your medical data to say your provider,

166
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,830
your hospital, your insurance company and

167
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,160
you're the one who is in control of that data permissioning.

168
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,820
And so therefore you're in control as a first pass as to who sees your very,

169
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,510
very private medical data.

170
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,160
And so encryption, a digital identity and anchored in

171
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,355
this very secure database technology blockchain

172
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:43,230
is absolutely going to make health care more secure,

173
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,115
put the patient in more control as well

174
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:53,820
as enable what I call gap filling is that today as you,

175
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,295
patients bounce between providers,

176
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,510
as providers bounce from state to state,

177
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,620
there are gaps and records.

178
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,670
And records for example for a provider in

179
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,445
North Carolina might be different from the records for a provider in Georgia,

180
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:13,410
even though it's the same provider.

181
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,410
It's just a information technology problem,

182
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,910
a data sharing problem that blockchain and some of these cross

183
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:37,630
organizational technologies really help to solve.

184
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:46,735
Absolutely. So based on my experience in Linux and I really saw Linux grow up from

185
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:53,200
a university project to a project that was trusted by startups

186
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,490
to a project that was trusted by

187
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,190
Fortune 500 companies and their data centers of their most critical data.

188
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:08,053
That flight path was really assisted by in large part Red Hat.

189
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:11,640
Red Hat took the open source community in one side,

190
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,800
enterprises in the other side.

191
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,280
Normally the open source community doesn't really get along with large business.

192
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:26,370
They're ideological, they're very have different motivations et cetera.

193
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,110
There are a lot of rough edges professionally.

194
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,320
And on enterprise they don't necessarily understand how to contribute to open source,

195
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,200
how to approach the open source community and how to

196
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,105
capture all that innovation that's coming out of open source.

197
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:45,960
Red Hat, their core idea was sitting in the middle and speaking

198
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,925
both open source and hacker ease and speaking enterprise on the other side.

199
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:54,145
And that's really the core vision for block,

200
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:59,640
is that blockchain has a lot of very fantastic,

201
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,325
very innovative developers with

202
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:06,615
themselves a bit of rough edges about them and enterprise,

203
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,385
specifically financial services and banks,

204
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,210
they have very, very specific compliance needs.

205
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,650
Risk needs legal needs and you need someone in the middle who can

206
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,720
talk blockchain to enterprise as well as talk blockchain to hackers,

207
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,820
bring the two together and create

208
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,145
a professional risk adjusted product that is essentially enterprise grade blockchain.

209
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:38,675
So that's what block does is we sell an enterprise blockchain product to small startups,

210
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:42,500
large enterprises sort of the Red Hat of blockchain.
