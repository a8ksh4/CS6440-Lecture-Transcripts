1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
A Health Information Exchange or HIE is

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,885
a specialized network for secure sharing of patient data.

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:10,500
There are various HIE architectures that correspond

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,670
functionally to the three forms of interoperability we discussed earlier.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,670
You should recall that the first form of interoperability is

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,160
simple transport of the data from one provider to another.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,035
The transport mechanism has no knowledge or understanding of the data.

8
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:35,515
ONC created the Direct Project in 2010 to specify a simple, secure, scalable,

9
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:40,135
standards-based way to send authenticated encrypted health information

10
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:46,395
directly to known trusted recipients using secure email.

11
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:52,310
This is a graphic illustrating Direct or simplification it assumes among other things,

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,685
that both providers are using the same Direct server

13
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:59,370
which is called a Health ISP or HISP.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,385
You can see the Direct bills on existing technologies for email and securing data.

15
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:07,850
We will discuss those in a moment.

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,998
Most EHR, HIE and PHR vendors including HealthVault, support Direct.

17
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,350
Here, I have clicked on the HealthVault,

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,285
Health messages menu choice.

19
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,475
You can see that my HealthVault account

20
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:24,485
automatically provides me with a special Direct email address

21
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,180
that can be used to securely send and receive

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,855
health data only to or from other Direct email addresses.

23
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:36,620
In Sunny HR's providers can initiate Direct messages from within

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,758
a charting session such as when they're referring a patient to another provider.

25
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:47,720
We will now briefly discuss some of the standards and processes used by Direct HISPs.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,390
To ensure secure transport,

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,540
Direct combines the Simple Mail Transport Protocol or SMTP with

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:04,020
special Direct email address as we just discussed and associated with X.509 certificates.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,455
In most cases, an entity wishing to have an email address and credentials issued

30
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:16,190
goes through a process documented in a trust framework established by DirectTrust,

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:23,955
a collaborative nonprofit association of health IT and healthcare provider organizations.

32
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:28,250
This trust framework supports both provider to provider and

33
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,870
bi-directional exchange between consumers or patients and their providers.

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,690
Direct uses Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME),

35
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,830
a public key standard for encrypting e-mail attachments

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,095
can be in virtually any format from a fax image to a PDF,

37
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:54,810
to a structured XML formatted, HL7, CCDI document.

38
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,045
Direct uses encrypted and signed Message Disposition Notifications

39
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:03,515
(MDN) to confirm delivery.

40
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:07,100
This can be particularly important in situations such as when

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,810
a lab sends a critical result back to the ordering provider using Direct.

42
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,200
Domain Name Servers (DNS),

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,628
the internet's equivalent of a phone book,

44
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:19,535
maintain a directory of domain names

45
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:23,465
and translate them to Internet Protocol IP addresses.

46
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:27,830
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,540
an Internet protocol in e-mail and

48
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,120
other programs used to look up information from a server.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,360
Direct uses both DNS and LDAP to discover the certificates of

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,880
message recipients prior to sending

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,000
a message in order to fulfill the encryption functions of S/MIME.
