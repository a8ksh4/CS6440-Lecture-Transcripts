1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
You will recall that the second form of interoperability

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,365
provides a structure that contained the elements,

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:11,625
so that the receiving system knows what each element represents,

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:16,260
even though it may have no semantic understanding of its contents.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,350
A common example is electronic lab reporting

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,903
results back to the provider who ordered a test.

7
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:29,195
Earlier, we mentioned HL7's Messaging Standard that dates from the 1980s.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,310
The version 2 standard, you see,

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,935
here is based on edX 12 technology from that era.

10
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:39,783
The two lines in red are test results.

11
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:43,660
You can see that other lines may contain only a text message.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,335
So this is not entirely a tightly structured standard.

13
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,180
With some study, you should be able to figure out

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,230
the contents of most of the fields in this message.

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,450
You should also agree that it is not nearly as human

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,355
readable as an XML formatted message.

17
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:06,053
The newer v3 HL7 Messaging Standard uses XML.

18
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:10,747
But v2 is baked into many existing systems,

19
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:13,010
and according to the CDC,

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,760
and despite its age in 2013,

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,240
90% of electronic lab reporting consisted of HL7

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
compliant messages using various versions of the v2 Messaging Standard..
