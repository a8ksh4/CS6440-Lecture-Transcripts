1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,929
The most sophisticated form of HIE creates semantic interoperability,

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,470
thereby bridging the many ways the same concepts can be

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,625
expressed by providers and represented in EHRs and other clinical systems.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:20,580
This involves a complex process that maps external representations of

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,119
clinical concepts to some standard developed or adopted by the HIE.

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,680
The premier example of this here in the U.S. is

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,053
the Indiana Health Information Exchange or IHIE, pronounced, "I-hi."

8
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:41,035
It says it is the largest such organization in the country.

9
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:48,265
This claim is easy to believe based on these participation statistics from the IHIE site.

10
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:53,015
Here you see a high-level diagram of the IHIE technical architecture.

11
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:56,600
The data governance box is where the curation of data

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,510
occurs to establish semantic interoperability.

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,660
Here on the right, you see that this governance enables a number of value-added services.

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,755
These include the reporting of laboratory test results we discussed earlier and of

15
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,850
the quality metrics that are increasingly required for

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,660
providers under the new payment models we discussed in lesson one.

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,565
The Regenstrief Institute in Indiana created

18
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:28,505
the expensive and sophisticated technology used by IHIE.

19
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,665
Support for that came from the Regenstrief Foundation,

20
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:36,910
a philanthropic organization that describes its mission as,

21
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,775
"To bring to the practice of medicine

22
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:43,090
the most modern scientific advances from engineering,

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,415
business and the social sciences;

24
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,340
and to foster the rapid dissemination into

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,585
medical practice of the new knowledge created by research."

26
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:56,170
Absent such unfortunately rare funding source,

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,725
this type of HIE is usually economically impossible to create.

28
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,825
In the case of IHIE,

29
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,531
as you see here,

30
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:10,165
all the curated data is aggregated and stored centrally.

31
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:16,110
This architecture is convenient for data governance, analysis and reporting.

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,810
However, it makes buy-in difficult for organizations that might be leery of turning over

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,455
their data and concerned about how it may be used and how their performance might look.

34
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:33,120
Again, Indiana has a special case where, over the years,

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,305
IHIE has gained the trust of the many care organizations we saw enumerated earlier.

36
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:42,500
This level of trust in a shared,

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,700
centralized architecture is rare.

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,785
The concept of a federated HIE goes a long way toward resolving these concerns.

39
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:56,870
In this model, the data stays at the source.

40
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,560
There is a standard for queries and responses and,

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,745
based on the query,

42
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:06,260
participating organizations usually have the option of responding or not.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,410
In a federated model,

44
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,500
either the nodes must translate their data into

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,150
some standard response format or they must map

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,960
their information into a standard data model usually stored in

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,395
a separate server that can then serve to handle queries and responses.

48
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:30,110
By far the most successful example of this is

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:37,825
the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership or OMOP and its OMOP data model.

50
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,890
OMOP was created to enable

51
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,180
active drug safety surveillance with government and pharmaceutical industry support.

52
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,105
Here you can see its global reach.

53
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:52,915
We built our Georgia Tech FHIR server using the OMOP data model.

54
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:56,620
While we will not discuss it in any detail here,

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,127
there's also a model that blends the centralized and federated approaches.

56
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:05,410
In it, all data is stored centrally but in

57
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,670
so-called data lockers that remain under

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,760
the control of the entity that is the source of the data.

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,660
That entity typically has the same control of

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,860
the use of the data they would have in a federated model.

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,270
Next, we will talk to my Georgia Tech colleague, Dr. Jon Duke,

62
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,080
who came here from the Regenstrief Institue that created

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,384
the technology used in the Indiana Health Information Exchange.

64
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,410
Jon was also a founding member of

65
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,920
the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics or

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,360
OHDSI initiative that developed analytic tools for exploring data in the OMOP model.

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
This example is a heat map showing the distribution of

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,470
diagnoses in a population of synthetic patients on our Georgia Tech FHIR server.

69
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,000
Population-level analysis is not supported by FHIR but might be in the future.
