1
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,405
Thanks very much for having me, Mark.

2
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,990
So before coming to Georgia Tech,

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,650
I was at a place called the Regenstrief Institute which,

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,410
amongst informatics folks, is a pretty well-known place.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,100
It's the home of one of the earliest physician order entry systems called Gopher.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,810
Also the home base for LOINC which is well-known as well as OpenMRS,

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,105
a global open source medical records system.

8
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:38,100
Regenstrief Institute was a place

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,607
where I spent eight years focusing primarily on clinical decision support,

10
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,700
a lot of work about how we can design alerts that are more effective,

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,450
how we can create more influential designs

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,545
for driving behaviors and decision making amongst physicians.

13
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:56,610
Regenstrief Institute also is a place that has been a hub for

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,240
many years for I'm thinking broadly about the future of informatics,

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,220
and my time there was fantastic.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,160
I was very excited to have a chance to come down to Georgia Tech

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,490
and take some of the work that we've done in the academic medical centers and

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:25,460
bring it to a technology-oriented institution like Georgia Tech.

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,210
Sure, so OHDSI is originally, let me start over there,

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,880
so OHDSI actually originally formed as something called OMOP back in 2008.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,660
And that stands for the observational medical outcomes partnership.

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,440
OMOP itself was funded by the foundations

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,337
of the NIH which was kind of a collective of life sciences,

24
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,590
pharmaceutical companies that came together to say,

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,092
how can we understand observational health data

26
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:55,290
better and look at the research methods, in part,

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,920
to get ahead of what was called Mini-sentinel then Sentinel that was part of

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,205
an FDA initiative to use observational data to track drug safety.

29
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:08,505
The OMOP program was very successful in putting together a model of

30
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:12,585
clinical data, and it grew over a period of five years to

31
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:16,620
look at pharmacovigilance or drug safety in some very novel ways.

32
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,585
But at the end of the five year funding period,

33
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:22,410
the lead scientists said, we want to keep going and we want to answer

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,520
questions related to comparative effectiveness, related to data quality,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,940
related to value-based care and other areas in healthcare research.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,880
And so they banded together and converted OMOP into something called OHDSI,

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,060
which now has expanded to, as you mentioned,

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,780
a much larger set with data in the OMOP common data model on over 660 million patients.

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:59,800
There's participants in OHDSI from over 20 countries, So it's become quite large.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,440
So converting data from a source system whatever it may be,

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,980
whether it's a Medicare claims document,

42
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,030
whether it's from an electronic medical records system into the OMOP common data model,

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,440
which is the standard, is a process we call ETL: Extract, Transform and Load.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,890
And that's certainly used in other areas in addition to health care.

45
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,915
The reason it can be challenging is you have to really understand your data.

46
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,870
You have to understand the source data and

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,585
where different types of information are maintained.

48
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:30,823
You also have to understand the target common data model,

49
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:33,675
document and the format of how that works.

50
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:37,385
The most important thing around doing ETL or a transform

51
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,375
into the OMOP CDM is to have people understand the local data environment.

52
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,490
How it gets in there and, basically,

53
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,355
going through the process of mapping up codes can take some time.

54
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:50,150
The investment, though, is very worthwhile because once you've done it,

55
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,580
there's a lot of off the shelf capabilities that working at OMOP and OHDSI

56
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,980
brings you that are derived from the work of

57
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,700
people literally across the world using that same data model.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,545
One of the other great things about

59
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:07,040
OMOP as a common data model in the OHDSI network is that

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,150
a researcher in California at Stanford can write code that will run on data in Japan,

61
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,460
in Australia, in the UK,

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,980
all with a common code base.

63
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,480
So it allows people to ask a question in

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,885
their local home environment and actually get results coming in from all over the world.

65
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,740
I think there's very few other ways that you can do something on

66
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,709
that scale globally than with OHDSI and OMOP.

67
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,805
I would agree with that.

68
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:48,805
I think there are so many nuances that have been, in fact,

69
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,610
proven out in many of the OHDSI research studies where we

70
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,730
look at the same question in different environments,

71
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,495
inpatient and outpatient environments,

72
00:04:56,495 --> 00:05:00,490
EMR-based environments, claims-based data environments and,

73
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,250
indeed, there is a huge amount of

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,815
variation that's based on local factors that need to be brought into account.

75
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:10,435
And it's not that you want to hide those but you want to understand,

76
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,450
you want to recognize and you want to account for them where you can.

77
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,710
So I would agree very much.

78
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,310
A federated model allows that individual local nuance to be brought

79
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,330
to it and it's probably the most effective way to go about doing observational research.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:41,690
Sure. We've just completed one study looking at a question that the FDA put

81
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,600
out on their website late last year

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,075
where they were looking at the question of the safety of a particular medication.

83
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:51,630
But it's a very rare adverse event they were curious about,

84
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,240
which something called angioedema.

85
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,850
You don't see it very much so if you want to study the risk of angioedema,

86
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,010
you're going to need millions and millions of patients to get at that question.

87
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,745
So with OHDSI, with a network that large,

88
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:06,315
you can actually ask a question of that across tens of millions,

89
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,400
even hundreds of millions of patients and be

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,470
able to generate information which, in this case,

91
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,330
we did and it'll be coming out in a journal currently in

92
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,475
press that did not show effect of that medication and the risk of angioedema.

93
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:23,245
Another great example of where we would use OHDSI in a research study is for looking at,

94
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:27,985
for example, the patterns of treatment across hundreds of millions of patients.

95
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:30,185
How are people being treated for hypertension?

96
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:31,915
How are people being treated for diabetes?

97
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:34,680
It may seem very intuitive that there's recommendations out for

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,895
the best process or pathway for treating hypertension.

99
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:41,400
But when you look at what's happening out in the real world it's very different.

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,125
So using the OHDSI framework allows you to look at these very large questions.

101
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,750
On a smaller scale, doing predictive models for individual patients,

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,250
the best way to generate an accurate predictive model for an individual patient is

103
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,670
to start with tens of millions of patients to begin with and hone in on.

104
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,570
So, generating predictive models around questions of safety,

105
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,000
questions of optimal treatment is another major use case OHDISI.
