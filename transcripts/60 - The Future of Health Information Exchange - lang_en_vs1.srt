1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
With the dramatic growth in open APIs, fire adoption,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,325
and the concept of health care app platforms,

3
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:13,965
it is tempting to speculate about the future of health information exchange.

4
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:18,405
Will specialized networks for health data sharing even be needed?

5
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:24,060
In an open standards based inter-operable Health Informatics landscape.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,740
Many have felt for some time now that cloud based platforms,

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,610
or coordinated collaborative care,

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,330
would wrap the complex mix of underlying EHRs and

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,630
other systems into something far more useful and usable.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,850
And some are coming from large companies with the expertise and

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,425
resources to take on hard long term problems.

12
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,670
Here you see a screenshot,

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,240
from the salesforce.com health cloud,

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,475
that the company announced in late 2015.

15
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,250
It represents a patients X terminal or

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,740
professional health care team on the right and allows them to interact with each other,

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,045
with the patient, and with the patient's internal team on the layout.

18
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,360
This internal team might, as shown here,

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,105
consist of family members or even professionals the patient has chosen to consult.

20
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,370
Earlier, I mentioned that the Veterans Administration was

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,790
a pioneer in EHR development. The V.A.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,100
is developing a cloud based digital health platform or

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,535
DHP to create inter-operability between its Vista EHR,

24
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,575
the military health system,

25
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:41,465
and community based care resources that use a variety of EHRs.

26
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,940
Georgia Tech created a proof of concept,

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,425
showing how fire could connect the V.A.

28
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:50,045
with community based providers outside its system.

29
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:53,810
The DHP could also provide health care data analytics,

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,785
ideally in real time,

31
00:01:55,785 --> 00:02:01,220
and an API for data extraction potentially creating an app platform.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,876
At least in its pilot form,

33
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:09,375
it uses a sales force health cloud for care coordination and patient management.

34
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,380
Here you see a diagram of

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,130
a possible HIE architecture in a fire enabled informatics ecosystem.

36
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,250
The HIE concept is still present,

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,380
but it has essentially become a platform for fire apps.

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,640
This second graphic suggests an HIE architecture that is entirely API based.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,660
These are all interesting and exciting new models for HIE.

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,285
It is possible that one of them will become the new standard.

41
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,960
It's equally possible that all three may find a role.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,772
But no matter what happens,

43
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,490
health care seems to be heading rapidly toward

44
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,610
an inter-operable framework with the potential,

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,395
among other use cases,

46
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:55,570
to address the long standing need for

47
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,880
continuous coordinated care of the chronic diseases we discussed in lesson one.
