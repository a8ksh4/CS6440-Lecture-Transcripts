1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,995
Data and interoperability standards are

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05,380
the virtually ubiquitous plumbing that underlie

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,905
most contemporary health informatics systems and tools.

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,395
Given the complexity of healthcare,

5
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:15,275
it should not be surprising that this is a complicated topic.

6
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,995
So we will divide it into three sections.

7
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:21,160
In this section, we will first discuss the evolution of

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,080
standards and then we will focus on standards for representing health data.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,580
In the next session,

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,803
we will discuss how that data is packaged,

11
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:35,275
transported and shared using interoperability standards developed before fire.

12
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:36,785
In the third section,

13
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:39,310
we will cover fire in some detail.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,640
Along the way, I will ask you to use some external web tools and APIs

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,910
to explore and better understand these important data standards.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,590
While they may be old,

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,210
they're used widely including in the latest fire standard.
