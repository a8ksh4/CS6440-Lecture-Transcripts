1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Why do we need data standards?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,611
We discuss that as a part of examining semantic interoperability,

3
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:09,750
but it's useful to consider it more specifically here.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,490
This simple illustration helps to make the differences and ambiguities in representing

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,355
healthcare data clear using a seemingly obvious data element, the patient's gender.

6
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:25,695
Here, system A represents males with a one and females with a zero.

7
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:29,685
Over here in system B, that is reversed.

8
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:33,368
The two systems are using the same language of ones and zeros,

9
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,355
so they are semantically similar,

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:39,900
but they cannot inter-operate without some intermediate translation process

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,740
that maps one to the other or both to some common representation.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,840
Should you mix data from these two systems without such an intervening curation process,

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,685
gender might be impossible determine

14
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,390
accurately for care delivery reporting and other purposes.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,690
Over in system C,

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,915
M is used for male and F for female.

17
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:06,000
System C is semantically different from systems A and B.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,135
It uses a different language to represent gender.

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:15,883
Moreover, system C recognizes that gender may be ambiguous and represents that with a U,

20
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,155
a concept the other two systems do not deal with.

21
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,840
Interoperability between system C and

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,750
the other two systems would require a translation from

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,780
its language to theirs or a translation of

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,680
all of these approaches to a common form, a standard.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,160
Since undetermined gender is not represented in systems A and B,

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,229
some accommodation for that would also have to be made,

27
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,410
particularly if the rate of undetermined gender is of interest for research or reporting.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,810
If something is seemingly simple as gender can lead to this much complexity,

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,510
imagine what happens with the concept of a patient's diagnosis,

30
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,970
which is inherently somewhat subjective,

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,850
can have thousands of possible values and,

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,085
as we'll see, can be described at varying levels of detail.

33
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:08,400
We've got a sense of that in the Applicadia video in the last lesson.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,925
That is why data standards have been developed.

35
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:14,245
But as we will also soon see,

36
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:19,000
they can themselves get quite complex and can be problematic as a result.
