1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
The five key data standards we will now discuss are

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,545
international classification of diseases, or ICD-10,

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:11,565
current procedural terminology (CPT ),

4
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:15,519
logical observation identifiers names and codes(LOINC),

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,330
national drug code (NDC),

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,445
and systematized nomenclature for medicine (SNOMED).

7
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:27,360
ICD and CPT are widely used in the US because in most cases,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,345
they are required for medical billing.

9
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:33,185
CPT and NDC are US-specific.

10
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:37,070
There are classifications although CPT increasingly has

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,430
sub-codes to provide more details about a procedure for more precise billing.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,320
LOINC is not quite an ontology,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,725
or provides significant details about clinical tests,

14
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:50,810
and is in use internationally.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,530
ICD-10 and SNOMED are internationally used ontologies

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,955
capable of representing clinical relationships among their elements.

17
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:02,860
When we discuss fire later on,

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,545
you will see that it builds on these data standards

19
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:09,000
and fire resources specifically reference them.
