00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
ICD is the oldest data standard dating directly back to the 1800s and

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,240
more indirectly to earlier centuries when researchers

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,005
became interested in the causes of human mortality.

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,110
One of these was John Gaunt,

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,460
who in the mid 1600s,

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,470
probably some of the first research on the causes of human mortality.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,465
The history of ICD is quite interesting,

8
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,825
so I posted a link you can read if you desire.

9
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:33,000
Traditionally, ICD was a list or classification of medical diagnoses,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,670
maintained by the World Health Organization,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,380
WHO, and updated every 10 years.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,165
ICD-10, adopted in 1994,

13
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,530
is the current version,

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,605
and work is well underway on ICD-11 for its schedule release in 2018.

15
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:55,635
The US finally adopted ICD-10 on October 1, 2015.

16
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,335
Well, after most other countries.

17
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:00,545
The switch was a substantial effort,

18
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:05,300
because ICD-10 is a major quantitative and qualitative expansion

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,495
of ICD-9 as you can see here.

20
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:12,515
ICD-10 has more than five times as many codes

21
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:16,175
to represent very specific clinical details.

22
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,740
Note that it can provide laterality,

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,200
so in this example for breast cancer,

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,985
it can indicate in which lower outer quadrant the disease was located.

25
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,515
In fact, ICD-10 is an ontology,

26
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:33,160
capable of representing clinical relationships.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,275
For example, as shown here,

28
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:40,445
we can encode the fact that the patient has gout affecting their left shoulder,

29
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:44,530
but they have not yet developed a uric acid deposit,

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,240
called a tophus, in that shoulder.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,750
ICD -10 codes are required on health care claims.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,390
Potential uses of the added detail in

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,830
ICD-10 could include more appropriate provider reimbursement,

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,135
and preventing fraud caused by duplicate billing for the same service.

35
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:07,530
However, as the Applicadia video demonstrates,

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,925
the complexity of the coding system is itself a problem for both providers and payers.

37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,400
You will find ICD-10 codes in FHIR resources.
