00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
Earlier in our discussion of health information exchange,

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:07,560
we mentioned the Regenstrief Institute in Indiana.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,930
The Institute also developed and it maintains

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,970
the LOINC code system for laboratory tests and clinical observations.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,032
You will find references to LOINC in a number of fire resources.

6
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:23,260
Each code is a number with up to seven digits.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,990
While the codes themselves are deceptively simple,

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,695
their names contain important details in their five or six components, as shown here.

9
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:37,370
These components or parts are separated by colons.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,690
In this example, the first part,

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,304
the component or analyte,

12
00:00:41,304 --> 00:00:43,230
a substance of interest is,

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,050
alpha-1 globulin, a protein that is a marker for inflammation.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,852
We can see here in the optional six part that electrophoresis determine it's level.

15
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,615
Here in the fourth or specimen part,

16
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:02,160
we see that the test was performed on a blood serum or plasma sample.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,995
Test results with a unit of measure of mass in the numerator,

18
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:12,920
and a volume like milligrams per decaliter in the denominator have mass concentration,

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,836
MCnc, as you see here in the fifth part.

20
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:23,050
Finally, Pt in the third part indicates that the measurement represents a point in time.
