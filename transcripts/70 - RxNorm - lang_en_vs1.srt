00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Pharmacy was an early target for health information technology.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,260
In fact, I worked on one of

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,085
the first ambulatory pharmacy systems in the early to mid 1970s.

4
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:16,080
As a result, codes for medications were also an early development.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,775
As the use of commercial pharmacy software grew,

6
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:25,520
companies created proprietary coding systems for the many aspects of medication

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,620
including clinical issues such as

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,720
drug drug interactions not covered by the simple NDC product codes.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,860
Starting in 2001, the National Library of Medicine

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,250
created RxNorm to reconcile these commercial codes.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,010
Each medication has a unique RxNorm RXCUI number

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,440
of up to eight digits that can be used to retrieve a great deal of information.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,090
You will find references to RxNorm in fire resources.
