1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,365
In the last lesson,

2
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:06,285
we looked at the evolution of standards and examined data standards in particular.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,930
For use in an actual patient care,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,130
standardized clinical data typically along

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,805
with other non-standardized data such as free text nodes,

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:19,450
must be packaged into a useful and usable form and

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,160
set using widely accepted data sharing standards and approaches.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,373
Many people feel that these standards and approaches will increasingly be FHIR APIs,

9
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:33,665
but only a few EHR installations currently support FHIR.

10
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,270
We will look at FHIR in the next lesson.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,430
In this one, we will look at the standards for

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,410
packaging and sharing data that predated FHIR.
