00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
In the last lesson,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,935
what I provided was actually a simplistic comparison between HL7 v2 and v3 messages.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,010
We will now look at that in more detail to help us understand

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,605
the evolution of HL7 standards development.

5
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:18,770
HL7 v2 is not plug and play.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,840
In fact, the concept was just getting started back then.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,480
In the hardware world, it certainly was not very common.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,470
V2 provides 80% of the interface and

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,420
a framework to negotiate the remaining 20% on a case-by-case basis.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,570
Thus, developing a v2 interface between

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,960
any two systems requires coding and has a certain degree of customization.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,465
Part of the reason why is that v2 is not based on a standard model.

13
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:52,925
The key goal of HL7 v3 development was to get as close to plug and play as possible.

14
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,455
It uses the Reference Information Model,

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:00,000
or RIM, in an effort to provide consistency across the standard.
