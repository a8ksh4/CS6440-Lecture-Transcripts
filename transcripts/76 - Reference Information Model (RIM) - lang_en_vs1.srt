1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,755
The goal of the HL7 Reference Information Model,

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:08,620
or RIM, is to document the actions taken to treat a patient.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,540
A request or order for a test is an action.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,960
The reporting of the test result is an action.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,460
Creating a diagnosis based on test results is an action.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,440
Prescribing treatments based on a diagnosis is an action.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,360
RIM defines the semantics of a common set of

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,510
administrative financial and clinical concepts

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,995
in order to describe these actions and foster interoperability.

10
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,455
Here you see a diagrammatic representation of

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,870
all the RIM concepts or classes and their relationships.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,795
I provide a link to a webpage from which you can explore them all.

13
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:51,620
The four shown here are core or backbone classes.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,420
Every happening is an act that is either being done,

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,940
has been done, can be done,

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,370
or has been requested or ordered.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,400
Examples include clinical observations,

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,810
medication administration, medical procedures or patient encounters.

19
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,900
Act relationships represent connections between acts such as composition,

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,835
preconditions, revisions and support.

21
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:22,790
Participation defines the context for an act such as author,

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,010
performer, subject or location.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,840
The participants have roles such as patient,

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,040
provider, practitioner, specimen or health care facility.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,130
Entities such as persons, organizations, material,

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,385
places or devices play these role.

27
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:45,495
How can a single act class represent all of the elements of a clinical action?

28
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:48,325
Their definition, requesting or ordering them,

29
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,235
or reporting the result.

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,550
This is the role of the Act.moodCode that

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,120
specifies whether the act is an activity that is defined,

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,435
is an event, has been requested or ordered,

33
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:04,615
or is promised, or is the subject of a future appointment.

34
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:10,735
Here's an example of a patient registration message in both V2 and V3 formats.

35
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:15,115
You will not find anything related to RIM up here in the V2 message.

36
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,550
Down here in the V3 version,

37
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,275
you see processingModeCode Code=T.

38
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:23,541
Over on the FHIR website,

39
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,960
you can easily find this table that explains

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,820
the possible values of this code, its value set.

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,975
And T indicates current processing.

42
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:36,435
So that is the status of this patient's registration.

43
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:39,490
The state of processing of an administrative task is

44
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,205
but one example of the great level of detail in RIM.

45
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,267
To get a further feel for this,

46
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:50,285
let's focus on the special arrangement code for this patient encounter.

47
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,425
We see here that this is a leaf of the act,

48
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:56,175
meaning it is a particular example or instance.

49
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,745
Its value is DSET, D-S-E-T.

50
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:03,430
It indicates there is a discrete set of possible values.

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,060
Again, a value set for this field.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,190
Once again, as you see here,

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,505
the FHIR site is a great way to discover these values.

54
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:15,920
These codes for special things a patient might need at arrival for

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,788
an encounter and the possible values are wheel for wheelchair,

56
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,645
add-bed for additional bedding,

57
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:28,000
int for interpreter, att for attendant and dog for guide dog.
