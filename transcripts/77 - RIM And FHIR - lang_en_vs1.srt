00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,990
You might be wondering where I found the value sets for

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,260
RIM codes over on the FHIR website.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,360
Earlier, I said that FHIR builds on existing standards.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,275
And that is true for RIM as well but with exceptions.

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:18,410
Scope. It should be clear by now that the goal

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,650
of RIM is comprehensive representation of the health care domain.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,150
FHIR resources represent only those data elements

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,625
that are expected to be used by most implementations.

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,115
FHIR uses an 80% rule.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:37,865
If approximately 80% of systems using resource will support a particular data element,

11
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,550
then it is part of the core standard.

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,765
A specific subdomain can add other elements as needed using FHIR extensions.

13
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:50,330
FHIR profiles both constrain resources for

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,515
use case and define extensions appropriate to specific subdomains.

15
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,380
Source of data elements.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,590
All data elements in HL7 v3 instances come from either the RIM or

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:10,165
data types developed by the International Organization for Standardization or ISO, I-S-O.

18
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:16,720
In FHIR, this is true of most but not all resources and data type elements.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,625
Some FHIR resources deal with content that is outside of the RIM scope.

20
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,575
And in a few instances,

21
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:28,160
FHIR adjust data types to accommodate issues not yet supported in RIM.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,045
Nuance. As you've seen,

23
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:36,425
RIM attempts to convey the meaning of instances through attributes like the mood code.

24
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:42,595
FHIR codes are generally limited to attributes with a rather concrete business meaning.

25
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:46,280
Finally, in FHIR, a value set is just another type of

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,390
resource that can be sent as part of an instance just like any other piece of data.

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,100
As a result, although FHIR uses RIM data elements,

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,565
it's possible to implement FHIR with absolutely no knowledge of the HL7 RIM.

29
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,000
This greatly facilitates rapid development.
