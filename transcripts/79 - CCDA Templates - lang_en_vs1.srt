1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,945
CCDA documents are assembled from templates,

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:08,530
essentially reusable XML components.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,300
Templates are defined at the document,

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,140
section, or data entry level.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,590
These correspond conceptually to

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,700
a paper form where the document as a whole consists of sections,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,340
each of which consists of fields into which data is recorded.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,360
Here is the CCD we just looked at,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,225
but I have now also highlighted two references to templates.

10
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:39,760
There are CCDA template guides posted and I've provided a reference to one from HL7.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,460
Templates have an OID,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,710
a globally unique ISO identifier.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,370
As you can see, the first has

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:57,631
an OID of 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.1.1.

15
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:02,460
The second differs from the first only in the last digit.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,565
Both of these are document-level templates.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:10,255
The first defines a document header for use in the U.S. domain.

18
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:13,850
This serves a purpose quite similar to FHIR profiles

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,875
in that it constrains the document to U.S. specifications.

20
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,420
Here you can see that it specifies that there must be

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,030
exactly one realmCode and its value must be U.S..

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,725
It is more interesting to look at the second template.

23
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:31,520
This specifies constraints for a continuity of care document or

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,330
CCD in conformance with stage one meaningful use.

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,130
Here, you see that it specifies the sections that must be contained in

26
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,490
the CCD so that it adequately supports use cases such as transitions of care.

27
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,490
Each of these refers to a section template and

28
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,300
the HL7 site provides links to these more granular templates.

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,300
If you first click on the link to the medication section template,

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,110
and from it click on the medication activity link,

31
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,690
you get to this data entry level template.

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,930
Note that it in turn links to specific value sets such as the medication route.

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,450
Clicking on that link brings up a page listing all the routes

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,320
specified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,110
It also links to specialized data entry templates.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,280
This one is the medication information entry level template

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,015
that could even contain a pre-specified product strength,

38
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:38,865
form or concentration such as Amoxicillin 400mg/5mL suspension.

39
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:42,480
Clicking on its medication clinical generic drug link

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,000
shows that the specification must be made using RxNorm.
