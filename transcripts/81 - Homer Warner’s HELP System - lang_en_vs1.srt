1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,765
Beginning in the mid 1950s,

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:06,905
Dr. Homer Warner, one of the founders of Health Informatics,

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:09,770
began using computers for decision support in

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,775
cardiology at LDS hospital in Salt Lake City, now Intermountain Healthcare.

5
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:19,470
In the 1970s, Dr. Warner and his colleagues

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,560
created the Health Evolution through Logic Processing,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,510
or HELP system, one of

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,750
the first electronic medical records systems and

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,190
perhaps the first designed to assist clinicians in decision making.

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,547
Intermountain replaced HELP II,

11
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:35,985
the successor to HELP,

12
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:39,210
with the Center system in 2015.

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,745
Dr. Warner died in 2012 and Intermountain named its research center after him.

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:49,605
The American Medical Informatics Association, or AMIA,

15
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:55,595
awards a cash prize in Dr. Warner's honor each year at its annual symposium.

16
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:56,970
You can see here that

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,350
the HELP system's knowledge based decision processor received data from

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,870
virtually all areas of the hospital to

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,800
provide a variety of clinical decision support tools.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,350
Expert panels organized much of

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,287
the clinical knowledge and an early example of knowledge engineering.

22
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,180
In fact, in 1997,

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,950
Dr. Warner published the book,

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,765
Knowledge Engineering and Health Informatics.

25
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:24,640
Here in a diagram from that book,

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,850
you can see how clinical findings link to a diagnosis.

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,290
Note that this includes logical rules stating that if

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,265
findings A or B and any of the two other four findings are present,

29
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,815
the diagnosis is confirmed.

30
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:44,590
Here you see that HELP uses bayesian statistics to relate findings to diagnoses.

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,300
Note here in this system diagram we saw earlier,

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,695
that HELP included a longitudinal clinical data repository.

33
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,915
I doubt that many in the field today

34
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:59,000
realize that such a system was functional that long ago.
