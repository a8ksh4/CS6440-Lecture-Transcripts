00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,875
In 2011, Australian HL7 standards guru,

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:08,850
Grahame Grieve, proposed a new interoperability approach

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,930
he called Resources for Healthcare or RFH.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,780
He said that it would define a set of resources to represent

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:24,065
granular clinical concepts for use on their own or aggregated into complex documents.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:30,685
In other words it would be composable so that unlike with complex CCDA documents,

7
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:35,785
developers could request only the information needed for their particular use case.

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,640
In part because of that he said this flexibility could

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,240
offer coherent solutions for a range of interoperability problems.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,515
He went on to say that technically RFH is designed for the web.

11
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:53,000
The resources are based on simple XML with

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,895
an HTTP based restful protocol where each resource has a predictable URL,

13
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:04,305
where possible open internet standards are used for data representation.

14
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:10,660
Later that year the HL7 board authorized a fresh look task force to

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,370
examine the best way to create

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:18,255
interoperability solutions with no preconditions on what those solutions might be.

17
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:23,600
The idea was not to start all over but that based on prior attempts

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,670
by HL7 and other groups the task force would consider new approaches to interoperability.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,980
Grahame joined the effort and at its outset hosted several key questions on his blog.

20
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,990
What are we trying to do?

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,640
What do our customers want?

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,635
What exchanges are we trying to serve?

23
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,710
Are we doing syntax or semantics?

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,550
Does the market even wants semantics?

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,820
HL7 has two quite different stakeholders in vendors and large healthcare programs.

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,435
Can they agree on what they want?

27
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:06,050
Grahame ended up leading the resulting standards development effort renamed

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:11,710
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources or F-H-I-R, FHIR.

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,900
We've touched on FHIR throughout the earlier parts of this course.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,240
Now we will look at it in more detail.
