1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,515
There are examples of most resources on the HL7 FHIR site in XML,

2
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:09,390
JSON and Turtle formats.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,620
Any student taking this course is probably familiar with XML and JSON.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,850
Turtle, Terse RDF Triple Language,

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,630
is a format used by the World Wide Web Consortium,

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,990
W3C, in its Resource Description Framework,

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,565
RDF data model for the proposed semantic web.

8
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:38,300
RDF extends the linking structure of the web using Uniform Resource Identifiers, URIs,

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,510
to describe relationships between things,

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,885
as well as the two ends of the link in a triple,

11
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:48,405
comprising a subject, predicate and object,

12
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:51,360
each of which can be a URI.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,200
This informal graph from the W3C RDF primer shows

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,035
how this construct could power a semantic web

15
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:03,375
that understands entities and their relationships.

16
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,810
Here as is often the case,

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,470
the Mona Lisa is at the center of attention.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,610
Here we see that Bob is a person who likes

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,595
this painting that was created by Leonardo da Vinci.

20
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:19,715
As in our earlier discussion of semantic interoperability,

21
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:22,250
it is worth considering whether there is a need for

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,215
a semantic formalism in an era when machines are increasingly figuring these things out.

23
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:32,510
I have posted links to the HL7 FHIR site's discussion of

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:39,000
RDF and to the W3C Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group.
