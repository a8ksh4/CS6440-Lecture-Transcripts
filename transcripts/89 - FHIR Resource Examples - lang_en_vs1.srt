00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,810
This simple example shows some key parts of an XML-formatted FHIR patient resource.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:15,550
Local information such as its last update and its local resource ID,

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,975
an HTML presentation of the key information for human consumption,

4
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:26,320
or if the receiving system is not able to interpret the structured information,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,055
any local extensions to the standard,

6
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:33,855
the standard-defined structured data content.

7
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:40,850
Here is an example of a JSON-formatted FHIR allergy intolerance resource.

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,965
The highlighted area contains the text for display for reasons we just discussed.

9
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:53,505
Here, I had removed that text so we can more easily focus on the structured information.

10
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:59,510
It begins by showing that this allergy problem is clinically active but is unconfirmed.

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,450
Patients often report allergies,

12
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,290
but that does not mean they experienced

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,360
an actual allergy as opposed to a medication side effect.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,900
This allergy is for penicillin,

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,665
and according to the Mayo Clinic,

16
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:16,795
research has shown that penicillin allergies may be over-diagnosed,

17
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:21,800
and that patients may report a penicillin allergy that has never been confirmed.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,750
A misdiagnosed penicillin allergy may result in the use of

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,445
less appropriate or more expensive and possibly more dangerous antibiotics.

20
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:36,800
Here, you see that this allergy is in the medication category.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,925
Medication is one of four allowed values for an allergy intolerance category.

22
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,250
Here you see the entire value set,

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,305
the list of allowed values for this data element

24
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:52,860
taken from the relevant page on the HL7 FHIR site.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,580
Food, environmental, and biologic allergies such as to

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,060
an X-ray contrast agent or a vaccination can also be documented using this resource.

27
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,510
Knowing that it is a medication allergy could be helpful to

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,115
software so that it knows to check on it when prescribing new medications.

29
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:18,060
Here you see a reference to an RxNorm code or RxCUI

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,855
7980 which is for penicillin G. Actually,

31
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:29,920
penicillin is a group of antibiotics and this is only one part of the penicillin group.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,925
Patients allergic to one member of the group

33
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:36,640
are usually presumed to be allergic to the entire group.

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,495
So I think the RxCUI of 70618 might have been a better choice.

35
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,500
I'll leave it to you to verify that and find out what

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,695
this RxCUI is for with the RxNorm tool you used earlier.

37
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:58,680
Here, you see that the allergy manifests itself as hives,

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,075
an outbreak of swollen,

39
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:04,525
pale red bumps or plaques or wheals on the skin.

40
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:08,920
This should be the SNOMED CT code for hives.

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,205
I leave it to you to verify that with the browser you used earlier.

42
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:16,645
These references to RxNorm and SNOMED CT

43
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:22,140
illustrate an important characteristic of FHIR we mentioned earlier.

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,515
It builds upon existing standards via

45
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:30,325
terminology bindings that specify these relationships.

46
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:35,270
Here, you see all the terminology bindings for this one resource.

47
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,865
I provide a link to a page from the FHIR site listing

48
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:43,460
all the terminology bindings used in the standard.

49
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,310
Here is a simple example to show how FHIR

50
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,820
also rests on key elements from earlier HL7 standards.

51
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,085
As you see here at the top,

52
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:58,200
the marital status value set comes from HL7 v3.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,380
If you go to the detailed description tab on the patient resource page on the FHIR site,

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,380
you will find this section for marital status.

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,000
Click here on the marital status codes link and you will get to the same table.
