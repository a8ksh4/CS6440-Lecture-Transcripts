00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,205
Prior to World War II,

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:07,485
U.S. patients paid for most healthcare which was relatively inexpensive,

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:11,415
until the beginning of high tech medicine in the 1970s.

4
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:15,030
After the war, the U.S. economy experienced

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,075
explosive growth and employers were competing for workers.

6
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:25,195
Health insurance became an attractive but inexpensive employee benefit.

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,990
In the early 1960's,

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,680
the Federal Government created two major new health insurance programs,

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,340
Medicare for citizens over 65 and

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,620
Medicaid primarily for the poor and those with certain disabilities.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,770
This graphic from the California Health Care Foundation,

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,420
shows our complex mixture of payment sources,

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,540
the contributions of which vary with the kind of care.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,210
Until quite recently, most payments for health care services were pay for procedures,

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,245
where in simple terms,

16
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,720
individual providers and hospitals are paid,

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,230
on the basis of how much care they deliver.
