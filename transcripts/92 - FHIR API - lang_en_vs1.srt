1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
There are four FHIR paradigms to accommodate different workflows.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,880
They are the FHIR REST API,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,540
FHIR Messages, FHIR Documents,

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,580
and FHIR-based web services.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,785
We will not cover message or document-based exchange,

6
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,470
but you should be aware that they exist and are potential replacements for

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,920
the earlier HL7 messaging and document standards we've discussed.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,975
I refer you to the FHIR site for discussion of these paradigms.

9
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:34,070
The site also discusses the potential use of FHIR in

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,170
web services based on other service-oriented architectures.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,615
The FHIR API paradigm uses representational state transfer, REST,

12
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:47,590
that relies on a client-server stateless,

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,630
cashable communications protocol, typically, using HTTP.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,995
Here, you see a simple illustration of the FHIR HTTP format.

15
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:02,485
The endpoint or base is the address of the FHIR server.

16
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:07,275
This is followed by a resource type and its resource ID.

17
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,960
This example would find the patient with

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,950
a resource ID of one on this particular FHIR server.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,435
I assume anyone taking this course knows what client-server architecture is.

20
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:25,400
As shown here, statelessness essentially means that

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,845
the necessary information to handle the request is contained within the request itself.

22
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,600
This might be as part of the uri,

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,110
query string parameters, body, or headers.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,605
Thus, with no prior knowledge,

25
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:42,367
and no need to remember the transaction,

26
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:45,920
any machine in a vast server farm could handle the request,

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,185
return the appropriate response,

28
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:51,130
and be available for the next request.

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,390
The response from the server to the client is similarly self-contained.

30
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,820
Clients can cache responses.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,990
Well-managed caching, partly or completely,

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,795
eliminate some client-server interactions,

33
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:09,520
further improving scalability and performance.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,275
In FHIR, the four HTTP verbs,

35
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,985
host, get, put and delete, implement CRUD.

36
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,710
Post creates new resources,

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,555
get reads existing resources,

38
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:27,255
put and delete update or remove existing resources.

39
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:32,610
Here, you see a complete list of the currently defined logical FHIR interactions.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,690
This part of the standard is at maturity level five,

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,755
so it's essentially in the final form.

42
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,410
Note the three sections,

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,820
instance, type, and whole system interactions.

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,965
In the instance section,

45
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:50,590
note that patch, a fifth HTTP verb,

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,645
can be used when a client is seeking to minimize its bandwidth utilization,

47
00:02:55,645 --> 00:03:01,800
or in the scenario that a client has only partial access or support for a resource.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,545
This might be the case in healthcare given the emphasis on privacy and security.

49
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,617
In the type section,

50
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:13,015
note that FHIR defines two interactions of particular interest in healthcare.

51
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:19,465
History retrieves the sequence of prior instances of either a particular FHIR resource,

52
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,075
all resources of given type,

53
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:25,870
or all resources supported by the system.

54
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,720
History can be quite useful given the clinical importance of

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,970
trends and changes in patient status.

56
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,390
This is a good place to explain FHIR bundles.

57
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,820
These are a collection of resources into

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,250
a single instance along with some context information.

59
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,875
For history of a patient's blood pressure,

60
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,155
without specifying a time period,

61
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:51,455
the server would send an observation resource bundle

62
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:54,795
containing all of the past measurements.

63
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:59,490
However, a bundle need not consist of the same resources,

64
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,370
so when representing some summary of a patient's record

65
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,420
would likely contain many different resource types and values.

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,720
Here's an example of that using the public Hapi.Server.

67
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,975
A search for the observations for Patient 10506 has found 12 of them.

68
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,980
Here is the accompanying JSON.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,885
You can see at the top that it is a resource bundle.

70
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:29,132
Next is the context information to put what follows in the proper perspective.

71
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:35,140
The first observation is a systolic blood pressure of 130 millimeters of Mercury.

72
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,305
The next one is for heart rate,

73
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:40,160
a clinically different observation.

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,923
The value is off screen but should you be curious,

75
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:46,091
it's 68 beats per minute.

76
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,610
Also, in the type section,

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,820
search is a particularly rich and important part of the FHIR standard.

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,604
In the simplest case,

79
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,815
a search is executed using a get operation,

80
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:00,910
where one or more name equals value pairs,

81
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,695
encoded in the URL, specify the parameters.

82
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:10,425
You can explore search using the forms provided on Grahame Grieve's FHIR server.

83
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,610
This is part of the extensive list of

84
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,500
search criteria for patients supported by the server.

85
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,315
As you can see, I've asked for all females born in 1955.

86
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:25,180
I get this one result, Eve Everywoman.

87
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,990
Try this yourself, and right after the server-based URL,

88
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,657
you will find patient/ specifying the resource to search.

89
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:36,655
If you look carefully in the long string that follows,

90
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:41,490
you will find birthDate=1955 and gender=female,

91
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,045
the two operative name equals value pairs.

92
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,705
When you try it, keep in mind that the data on public servers can change,

93
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:53,048
so this particular example may or may not work as it does here.

94
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,770
Searches are constrained to one of

95
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,102
three contexts in order to control what resources are considered.

96
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:04,080
I'll discuss each and show you the applicable format.

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,145
A specified resource type,

98
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,250
as in the example we just did,

99
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,410
where this was patient resources.

100
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,575
A specified compartment, that might be a specific patient,

101
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:21,880
perhaps, with a specified resource type in that compartment.

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,770
We did that earlier when we look for observations for only Patient 10506.

103
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,590
All resource types where the parameters must,

104
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,390
of course, be common to all the resource types.
