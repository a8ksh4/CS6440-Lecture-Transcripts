1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Dr. John Halamka is

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,100
the Chief Information Officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,580
Chairman of the New England Health Care Exchange Network,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,630
Co-Chair of ONC's HIT Standards Committee,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,810
a full professor at Harvard Medical School,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,660
a practicing emergency physician,

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,300
and an accomplished farmer.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,155
In late 2014, he announced the Argonaut project,

9
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,870
a private collaboration in which each of

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,095
the participants agreed that all specifications and

11
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:41,585
artifacts developed would be openly available via an open content license.

12
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,840
Since the participants included many of

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,108
the largest health IT vendors and leading health care systems,

14
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:51,365
this was a very significant development.

15
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:55,580
The three initially proposed and now posted deliverables are,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,075
FHIR Data Query Profiles,

17
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:02,740
a set of FHIR resources and accompanying profiles that enables

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,650
query/response of the discrete data elements

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,320
contained in the Meaningful Use Common Data Set.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,570
FHIR Document Query Profile.

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,150
A FHIR resource and profile that enables

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,970
query/response of Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing XDS,

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,340
a specification for managing the sharing of

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,790
documents between healthcare provider organizations.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,200
XDS is commonly used by health information exchanges to connect to EHRs.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,965
Security Implementation Guide,

27
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:41,630
based on the SMART on FHIR OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect profiles.

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,690
These are the key tools for establishing

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,665
identity and access rights to data for SMART and FHIR apps.

30
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:51,580
We will discuss this in more detail in the next lesson.

31
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,250
Two newer deliverables are the Scheduling Implementation Guide.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,830
This supports basic patient and provider

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,130
access to providers calendar and appointment requests,

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,660
including APIs and guidance for searching and publishing a provider schedule,

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,070
and requesting, canceling, or updating an appointment.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,280
CDS Hooks Implementation Guide.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,915
Argonaut is developing use cases,

38
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:21,755
providing guidance and publishing an implementation guide for deploying CDS Hooks.

39
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:26,180
Argonaut leverages the data access framework we mentioned earlier,

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,020
and it's compatible with prior interoperability efforts.
