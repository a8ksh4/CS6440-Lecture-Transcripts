1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,990
Grahame Grieve. I'm an Australian.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,300
I began my life as a bench scientist in a clinical laboratory.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm in a clinical research,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,920
jumped ship to join a vendor and become a developer,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,100
and eventually the CTO of the laboratory systems vendor.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,955
Spent more and more of my time doing actual serving and interoperability.

7
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:27,290
Generally, got more involved in HL7.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,815
Went at freelancing national expert in CDI adoption,

9
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:34,670
realized that all the passwords on were wrong,

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,340
went off in FHIR,

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,400
and accidentally ended up as a FHIR product director which is what I am now,

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,585
responsible for stewarding the FHIR community and the standard

13
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:52,730
towards maturity and towards making a real difference in the healthcare industry.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,270
It's a combination of things.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,880
First of all, it's the right idea at the right time.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,085
The industry, the community is really ready for

17
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:09,890
a spec that uses web technology and web principles and that's what we had.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,540
And also, we created open community that was

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,305
very dynamic and community-led. And we did that.

20
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:20,970
We're just learning from other people who had done the same thing in other communities.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,350
And their willingness to copy the good ideas from wherever they come

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,690
from has created a community that is excited,

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,155
and that excitement both led onto,

24
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:36,905
in the end, a really formal standards processes.

25
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:39,225
Pretty compelling combination for people.

26
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:44,180
And that's seems to be doing it so far.

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,845
Yeah, and a lot of app processes are around finding

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:56,400
a balance between many competing points of view with those in particular.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,860
And so, partly, it's about being really willing to get a feedback

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,145
because there's no perfect answer to choose your engagement.

31
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:10,640
And that's the beauty of actual serving as a formal standards process that backs it,

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,515
is that people know that it will become a standard and a call to engage.

33
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:21,440
And so we have a real advantage in terms of bringing together everyone who needs to

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,435
be here or not able to just go some project that we won't have to buy attention to.

35
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:31,046
That's got some problems but it does make it really easy to engage,

36
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,340
and the other part is an intuitive process to

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,885
try something for feedback, get some feedback,

38
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,765
try something slightly different and eventually,

39
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,495
you'll see the community

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,870
automatically congregate around a single solution at a single point.

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,660
And so initially, things go in and there's a lot of changes.

42
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,020
Everybody settles around the idea,

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,185
but you can see it automatically.

44
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:00,100
People stop complaining and start working with it,

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,694
because you've let everybody circle and come to agreement organically.

46
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:10,045
And we see that person is repeating a lot

47
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:18,640
and we seem to be on a workable path to a meaningful standard.

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,500
Instead, it's a kind of tricky because you can easily

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,160
impose a standard from above - top 10 standards process.

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,560
And if you do that, you'll often get a stand that everybody says they cannot conform to.

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,610
But nobody really actually will,

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,310
because it doesn't really do what they need.

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,630
And so, you have to let standards develop bottom-up.

54
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,610
But if you let standards develop bottom-up only,

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,685
who knows what you'll get.

56
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,385
And it's an art form of balancing that two.

57
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,329
Often compared to a slinky dog,

58
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,015
the dog with a big spring between the front in the back.

59
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:54,635
Like, the back and the front can go in different directions,

60
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,865
but only for a little while.

61
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,510
They tied together and I think it's the same very

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,450
much with top-down and bottom-up standards design.

63
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:13,350
Yeah. Look, I feel as though we're half way in that.

64
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,820
But we get new scopes brought to us all the

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,200
time and some more scopes that I never expected to take on.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,990
And, some of them,

67
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,140
the resource gets adapted to new scopes and some of them split off or added in.

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,325
And so, we don't have a formal goal in terms of that and in terms of how big,

69
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,755
I think more in terms of community

70
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:49,214
and adoption size rather than how big is the specification.

71
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:52,835
And I've sort of thought

72
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:57,530
that the right ballpark figure of how big the community is is a trillion dollars.

73
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,010
I mean, that's how much money

74
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,370
is being spent in the space of health care interoperability and

75
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:12,615
systems and that so the system is bounded by FHIR that will connect three FHIR.

76
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,651
The money all goes elsewhere,

77
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,560
but if you change this,

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,295
if you took FHIR away and put something else in,

79
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:23,320
then that have to re-spend all the money because that bridge is on to

80
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,498
a different set of ideas over a 20-year period.

81
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:30,240
That's the kind of dollars you're talking about.

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,260
And it's a lot of money and that's why it's really

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,500
important to have good governance and formal standard governance

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,190
because that's the kind of money that people are choosing to

85
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,520
invest somewhere around the world.

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,530
You measure it in terms of percentage of the world GDP, in fact.

87
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:56,320
It's not spent on FHIR but it's spent in the space bounded by FHIR.

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,920
Yeah, I have been surprised.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,020
So I thought, we've consistently been running ahead of where

90
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,695
we thought we'd be in terms of standards adoption.

91
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:16,795
And it's pleasing for us that the work that we put in is starting to have an impact.

92
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:19,400
We're certainly just starting out.

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,070
I see standards, this is like

94
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,143
a river at the headquarters and the water flows down through the river,

95
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,650
the standards process is

96
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,229
a 20-year time-frame and we're sort of five years into the 20-year time frame.

97
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,870
And we're still mainly focused at

98
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,005
the top end where we've got much more adoption we expected in that time.

99
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:44,220
And so, that bodes well

100
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:52,010
for our ability to create change in the health care system which is our real goal.

101
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,380
The increased availability of data increases

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,930
the interest in doing stuff with the shared data in signing setup shared processes.

103
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,830
And there's a lot of interest in that.

104
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,485
And I feel as though, the fact that you can get data,

105
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:18,710
creates the expectation and desire to share processes.

106
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,305
And sharing processes has always been our goal, sharing data.

107
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:24,470
So what you've got data,

108
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,453
it's about being able to build processes on top of that.

109
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:31,730
And also the fact that there are servers,

110
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,220
we've always in the specification allowed for writing data back in.

111
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,012
And there are systems that do that out there,

112
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:42,460
that creates a competition and

113
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,510
the perception that you should be able to if only you had done the work,

114
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,390
on the other hand, it's a lot of work.

115
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:56,221
You really need to re-conceive your job to open it up that much.

116
00:07:56,221 --> 00:08:00,765
And so, it's in spite of the fact that everybody wants it to happen.

117
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:04,340
It's not just flick the switch and make it happen,

118
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,657
you've got to do a lot of engineering,

119
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,325
it means move your business rules around.

120
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,460
It's a big work.

121
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,980
And so it's taking some time for the vendors to get there.

122
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,545
And they're not there yet,

123
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:23,066
but they're thinking about it and working on them.

124
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:29,285
So it's already happening in a lot.

125
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:31,630
It's certainly true that there's

126
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,230
a wide spread perception that main focus is EMR tighter access.

127
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,345
And there's a degree of politics to that.

128
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:41,890
There's a lot of projects that are just doing the work,

129
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,680
they're not making a lot of noise about it.

130
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,170
So for instance, the VIJ have a FHIR base project for aggregating observational data,

131
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,425
from the data collection devices that they're wearing.

132
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,030
You don't hear a lot of noise about that,

133
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,950
but they're using that.

134
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,665
There's a certain amount of politics going on in the kind of projects we do hear about.

135
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,620
And also, there's other countries,

136
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,710
the politics focus is different because there are at different stage in

137
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,146
the last cycle and they had different historical practices in the past.

138
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:25,760
That have meant that the politics is playing out in different parts of the ecosystem.

139
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,060
And so, when I look at it, there's a lot of noise about one part of it.

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,220
It's kind of happening.

141
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,780
We haven't really added anything to the spec,

142
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,565
unless there are people using it.

143
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,593
And people are taking up and using my space,

144
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:41,580
is the specification I think is.

145
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,770
I always say that the amount of interoperability you need is n_times_2,

146
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,505
where n is the amount that you have.

147
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:53,100
And as you get more bang for your buck,

148
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,775
as we can monetize more interoperability exchanges,

149
00:09:56,775 --> 00:10:00,030
people start looking to expand that because they start getting

150
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,505
benefit for the money they're spending and much more easily.

151
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,955
And so they start saying, "Well,

152
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:10,635
we'll pick off different functional areas and start working on those."

153
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:11,880
And we're going to see next year

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,230
some very large consumer initiatives around health data aggregation,

155
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,305
and collection, and leveraging, [inaudible] accessible data.

156
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:27,000
It certainly really starting to pick up now.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,960
And so, that will just increase the impetus towards

158
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,910
leveraging data sharing in new context and as I said,

159
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,860
setting up first new patient care processes.

160
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,750
So I think that's more and the politics of

161
00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:00,544
the EHR position that has led to a perception that it's about patient by patient access.

162
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:06,330
Well then, that is true that our focus is mainly being on very fine grained,

163
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,870
high availability access to the data,

164
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,550
very integrated between the two ends of the conversation.

165
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,990
And we're certainly having a lot of discussions

166
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,680
now about what it looks like to use the FHIR.

167
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,591
Symantec's is a interoperability base,

168
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,515
but to do so in the presence of very large amounts of data,

169
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:31,075
many gigabytes of data.

170
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:35,265
And that comes to fruition in that way now,

171
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:41,630
we're now working with ENRC to trawl what they're calling bulk data access,

172
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,635
which is pretty much are in feeding the big data systems.

173
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:50,720
I think that's going to be the role of FHIR's place is allowing

174
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
people working on big data [inaudible] and on PMI and other projects like that,

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,770
to access data on bulk,

176
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,638
and moving into big data analysis systems.

177
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:07,010
It remains to be seen how much direct involvement in

178
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:13,766
the big data side of things we can or should bring.

179
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:20,910
So, I've sort of seen FHIR's 15 year plan.

180
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,170
The first five years for initiating the community,

181
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,225
figuring out what FHIR was and what would make it successful.

182
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:34,140
The next five years we expect it to be a principal growth phase,

183
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,038
where we were building out the standard,

184
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,550
and then final five years,

185
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,380
you'd be consolidating the standard and building up solutions.

186
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,295
We've seen the adoption vices running ahead of that initial plan,

187
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:54,855
but it seems as if the standard process will follow that overall plan.

188
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,390
So, in five years time from now,

189
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,905
I want to be saying that the community is

190
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:07,545
a really significant factor in the overall healthy ecosystem.

191
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:14,495
The standard itself is mature and starting to move towards long term maintenance.

192
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,825
The community I'd like to see,

193
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:23,965
the community focusing on bringing home the processes that

194
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:30,550
we've imagine building on top of the availability of sharing of data in birth in,

195
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,470
as a free flowing liquid entity through the system.

196
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,970
And that consumers, whether they're governments who pay for

197
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:47,540
health care or private insurers who pay for health care or patients they get health care,

198
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,015
or they are getting value for money to an improved health care and improved outcomes.

199
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:59,350
And the one thing that I expect will be a big issue

200
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,410
in five years time is starting to really rethink clinical processes,

201
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,410
because we're in a new place.

202
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,150
And it's clear that clinical processes and the expectations of the relationship between

203
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:19,660
the consumer and the health care providing system need to change,

204
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,255
and we're in a position to support a different way of providing health care.

205
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:27,790
And that's going to be an interesting and at times, challenging discussion.
