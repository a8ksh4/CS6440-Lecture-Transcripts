1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
A universal health app platform to support

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,120
informatics-based innovations in care delivery,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,450
no matter what the underlying EMR was

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,030
a long held dream of the Academic Health Informatics community.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,550
In 2010, the Office of the National Coordinator of Health IT awarded

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,580
$15 million to the Boston Children's Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,540
and the Harvard Medical School Department of Biomedical Informatics

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,095
to create and initially develop just such an app platform.

9
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,510
The result was SMArt,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,390
an acronym for Substitutable Medical Apps,

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,780
reusable technology, and open standards

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,890
based technology with a robust community of app developers.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,875
A group of health care organizations joined

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,500
the smart advisory committee to support the effort through philanthropy,

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,490
strategic guidance, and deployment of the technology.
